# Cyber-Physical System Security Assessment (CPSSA)

The CPSSA module delegates its functions to existing open-source software solutions for Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA). These include [OpenTRICK](https://github.com/itrust-consulting/OpenTRICK) for a comprehensive risk management tool, assisting in assessing risk and planning actions accÂ­ording to ISO/IEC 27005, [threagile](https://github.com/Threagile/threagile) for DevSecOps oriented threat modelling (TM) and security risk assessment (SRA), [ADTool](https://github.com/tahti/ADTool2) for attack tree modelling and analysis, OWASP [Threat Dragon](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon) for GUI-based TM and [Capella Darc Viewpoint](https://github.com/eclipse/capella-cybersecurity/wiki) for more advanced and detailed TM using [Capella](https://mbse-capella.org/) for model-based systems engineering, following the [ARCADIA method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_(engineering)).

For more information, we refer the reader to our CPSSA report, published as part of the knowledge base elements of C5-DEC; see the README section on the [C5-DEC knowledge base (KB) reports](https://github.com/AbstractionsLab/c5dec/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#overview) to learn about gaining access to these. In our CPSSA report, in addition to providing a literature review, we describe our threat modelling and security risk assessment method adapted to the Common Criteria, while building on best practices and well-established methods such as the hybrid method developed by the software engineering institute (SEI) of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

For agile development, we recommend the use of [threagile](https://github.com/Threagile/threagile), while for more comprehensive risk management according to ISO/IEC 27005 with a detailed quantitative risk assessment approach following the ROSI method, we recommend [TRICK Service](https://www.trickservice.com/), enabled by the open-source [OpenTRICK](https://github.com/itrust-consulting/OpenTRICK) software, also further improved and released as open-source software in project [CyFORT](https://abstractionslab.com/index.php/research-and-development/cyfort/).
