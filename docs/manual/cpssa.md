# Cyber-Physical System Security Assessment (CPSSA)

The CPSSA module largely delegates its functions to already existing open source software solutions such as [threagile](https://threagile.io/) for DevSecOps oriented threat modelling and security risk assessment (SRA), [ADTool](https://satoss.uni.lu/members/piotr/adtool/) for attack tree modelling and analysis, [Threat Dragon](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/) for threat modelling and [Capella Darc Viewpoint](https://github.com/eclipse/capella-cybersecurity/wiki) for more advanced and detailed threat modelling using Capella, following the [ARCADIA method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_(engineering)).

For more information, we refer the reader to our CPSSA report, published as part of the knowledge base elements of C5-DEC. In our CPSSA report, in addition to providing a literature review, we describe our threat modelling and security risk assessment method adapted to the Common Criteria, while building on best practices and well-established methods such as the hybrid method developed by the software engineering institute (SEI) of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

CPSSA features currently planned for future development and releases of the C5-DEC CAD component include export of assets for direct use by threagile and the [TRICK Service](https://www.trickservice.com/) web application for risk management.
