## Overview

C5-DEC, short for "Common Criteria for Cybersecurity, Cryptography, Clouds â€“ Design, Evaluation and Certification", is a subproject of the CyFORT project, in turn short for "Cloud Cybersecurity Fortress of Open Resources and Tools for Resilience".

C5-DEC consists of two key elements: a software component and a knowledge base including guides and a wiki of key CC concepts. These elements complement each other to form a coherent set of tools aimed at supporting activities related to CC certification, secure software development life cycle and security assessment of cyber-physical systems.

One of the goals of C5-DEC is carrying out impartial assessments of the security of computer systems and software according to the Common Criteria (CC), a set of internationally recognized standards (ISO/IEC 15408), and the complementary methodology ISO/IEC 18045, dealing with a common methodology for computer security evaluation (CEM). CC certification gives users the assurance that a product satisfies the security guarantees and properties it claims to possess.

The CC and CEM are complex resources resulting from the efforts of several countries since 1980, and present an extensive catalogue of security requirements and a challenging methodology. The certification processes, involving vendors/developers and evaluation laboratories, are often costly and lengthy. 

The Common Criteria Toolbox (CCT) of C5-DEC is aimed at making these procedures more accessible and efficient, assisting analysts and designers in the design and evaluation of system/product-oriented information security with a comprehensive CC database and a CC browser for navigating and filtering specific parts of the DB in a targeted manner. The CCT also assist evaluators in the creation of evaluation checklists and ffor tracking the evaluation progress.

The SSDLC module of C5-DEC CAD aims at assisting with the development of secure software; this module supports the creation, storage and interconnection of requirements, architecture models, technical specifications, source code, test specifications, test execution reports and potentially other artifacts, within the same repository and using the same set of tools to allow for complete traceability.

Moreover, the C5-DEC methodology for secure software development life cycle (SSDLC) and a guide for Cyber-Physical System Security Assessment (CPSSA) form part of the C5-DEC knowledge base, and are supported by the SSDLC module of C5-DEC CAD.

Note that to fully implement the C5-DEC method described in the SSDLC and CPSSA reports, C5-DEC integrates and relies on other open-source solutions (e.g. doorstop-dev, OpenProject, GitLab, threagile, ADTool, Capella Darc Viewpoint, and Threat Dragon) for some of its features such as requirements and artifacts management, system design and testing, project (resource) management, DevSecOps, threat modeling, and security risk assessment.
