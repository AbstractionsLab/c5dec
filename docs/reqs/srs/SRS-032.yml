rationale: "The efficient evaluation of the TOEâ€™s readiness and compliance with relevant\
  \ standards is vital for ensuring \nthe security and reliability of the developed\
  \ system. By automatically aggregating and presenting SARs and \nwork units in alignment\
  \ with respective security assurance components, evaluators can swiftly and accurately\
  \ \nassess adherence to security assurance requirements, ensuring robust evaluation\
  \ processes and confidence in \nthe TOE.\n"

  As an Evaluator, I want the system to seamlessly aggregate and present SARs and associated work units,
  aligning them with specific security assurance components,
  so that the process of evaluating the readiness and compliance of a Target of Evaluation (TOE) is
  simplified and streamlined.

  1. When I select an SAR to assess the readiness or compliance of a TOE, I want to see the SAR description and
  the associated Work Unit description.
