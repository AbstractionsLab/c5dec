  - The System is able to store the CC data model in a specific format.
  - The stored format maintains a mapping to the available CC XML-file.
  - The System can validate the stored data against the corresponding DTD file.
  - The System preserves semantic relationships between CC concepts during storage and retrieval.

rationale: "Ensuring that the CC data model is stored and mapped accurately in a format\n\
  that can be validated against the DTD file and maintains semantic relationships\n\
  is critical for the integrity, reliability, and usability of the CC data. Accurate\n\
  data storage and mapping are essential for ensuring that CC data retrieval, \nmodification,\
  \ and usage within the system are correct and reliable.\n"

  As a System, ensure that the CC data model is stored in a format that maintains
  a mapping to the available CC XML-file and can be validated against the
  corresponding DTD file while preserving semantic relationships between CC concepts.
