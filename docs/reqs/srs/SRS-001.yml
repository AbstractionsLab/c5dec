  As a General User, I want to access and browse the database so that I can identify Common Criteria
  Security Components relevant to my project.

  Assuming I am logged in as an authorized user:

  1. I access the database containing the CC Security Components
  2. Then I should be able to see the Security Class Types _Assurance_ and _Functional_.
  3. When I select a Security Class Type the list of all respective Security Classes is displayed.
  4. Then I should be able return to the Security Class Type selection (see Step 5) or to select a
  Security Class (see Step 6).
  5. When I return to the Security Class Type selection, I resume to Step 2.
  6. When I select a Security Class, I should be able to see the content of the Security Class,
  and the list of Security Families pertaining to that Security Class.
  7. Then I should be able to return to the list of Security Classes (see Step 8) or select a
  Security Family (see Step 9).
  8. When I return to the list of Security Classes, I resume to Step 4.
  9. Repeat Steps 5 to 7 traversing the hierarchical structure until a Security Requirement is
  reached.
  10. At any time I am able to exit the database.
