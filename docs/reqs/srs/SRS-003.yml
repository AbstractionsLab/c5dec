  As a Developer, I want to be able to (select Security Components and) export (their respective)
  Security Requirements into a file so that I can e.g. import them into my project's REM system.

  Assuming that I am logged in as an authorized user:

  1. I access the database containing the CC Security Components
  2. Then I am able to specify or select a (set of) Security Component/s of type 'functional' and/or 'assurance'.
  3. When I specify or select a (set of) Security Component/s I expect the system to automatically assess the validatiy of
  the selection in terms of consideration of hierarchical and dependency relationships and to display the result
  4. Then I am able to export the selected Security Components' Security Requirements.
  5. When I select the export option I expect the system to warn me in case of an invalid selection
  6. Then I am able to ignore the warning or adjust my selection.
  7. When I proceed I am able to (at least) define the
    - filepath,
    - filename,
    - and format (csv, xlsx).
    Additional customizability to ease export to project's REM system format is desirable.
  8. Then all Security Requirements of the selected Security Components are
  exported to the defined filepath with the filename and in the defined format.
