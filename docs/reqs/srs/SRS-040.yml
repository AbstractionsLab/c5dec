rationale: "Explicitly flagging failed work units and inhibiting progression until\
  \ they are addressed ensures that \nissues are rectified promptly. Cascading these\
  \ flags to linked items ensures a rigorous and thorough \nevaluation and validation\
  \ process, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the evaluation and \ndevelopment\
  \ process and ensuring that dependent elements are not overlooked.\n"

  As a User,
  I want failed work units to be visibly flagged and to inhibit progression until resolved. Additionally,
  I want all items linked to a flagged work unit to also be flagged,
  so that all issues and potential dependent problems are duly addressed, ensuring a reliable, thorough,
  and systematic evaluation and development process.
