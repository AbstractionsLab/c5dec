  As a General User, I want to read comprehensive and user-friendly explanations of
  technical terms and concepts so that I can understand the Common Criteria without
  specialized prior knowledge.
  Assuming I am viewing an Article in the Knowledge Base
  1. When I encounter a technical term or acronym, it should be clearly defined or
  explained in laymanâ€™s terms.
  2. Optionally, a link to a detailed explanation or dedicated page for the term/acronym
  is available.
  3. I can navigate to this detailed explanation Article, if available, and return to the
  original content.
