  As a General User, I want to have direct access to a relevant FAQ section from Knowledge Articles,
   so that I can swiftly find concise answers to related questions.
  1. While reading a Knowledge Article, I should encounter links that direct me to an FAQ section.
  2. These links should be contextually relevant and provide additional, succinct information
  pertaining to the content being read.
  3. Links should direct users to a placeholder page if the FAQ section is not yet developed or
  available.
