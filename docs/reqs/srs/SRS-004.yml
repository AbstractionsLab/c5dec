  Ensuring that the Security Requirements can be tailored in compliance with the Common Criteria is crucial for aligning the projectâ€™s needs with standardized security benchmarks. Facilitating a structured and traceable method of managing requirement modifications while maintaining an archival system of original requirements ensures auditability and adherence to the Common Criteria, particularly for PP/ST.

  As a Developer,
  I want to tailor Security Requirements to my project's needs,
  So that the tailoring process and the resultant Security Requirements comply with the Common Criteria.
  Assuming I am logged in as an authorized user:

  Option 1: Export tailoring

  1. I access the database containing the CC Security Components\n
  2. Then I am able to specify or select a (set of) Security Component/s of type 'functional' and/or 'assurance'.\n
  3. When I specify or select a (set of) Security Component/s I expect the system to automatically assess the validatiy of
  the selection in terms of consideration of hierarchical and dependency relationships and to display the result\n
  4. Then I am able to export the selected Security Components' Security Requirements.\n
  5. When I proceed to export I will be able to iterate through all Security Requirements and tailor each\n
  to my project's needs. \n
  6. Then the system tracks the changes made to the original Security Requirements and includes the Common Criteria \
  required information in the exported file. \n

  Option 2: Parse tailored Requirements

  1. I access the database containing the CC Security Components\n
  2. Then I am able to provide a (set of) tailored Security Requirement/s in (TBD) format\n
  3. When I provide a (set of) tailored Security Requirement/s the system is able to automatically validate made changes
  and generate the Common Criteria required information for the tailored Security Requirement. \n
  4. Then I am able to export the provided (set of) tailored Security Requirement(s) with the additional information.\n
