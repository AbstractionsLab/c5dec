rationale: "Implementing a unified and structured storage mechanism ensures that data\
  \ related to SFRs/SARs \nand other CC elements is consistently stored and managed\
  \ within the C5-DEC document-based data \nstore, facilitating efficient data retrieval,\
  \ management, and overall system reliability.\n"

  As a User, I want the CC toolbox within the C5-DEC software to enable consistent and structured
  storage of various CC artifacts and security elements, ensuring ease of data management and
  integrity.

  1. When I choose to store SFRs/SARs, Security Functional Classes, Security Assurance Classes,
  Evaluation Activities, and Packages in the CC toolbox,
  2. I want the storage process to utilize the same open file format used for all artifacts
  ensuring uniformity,
  3. And store all elements in a structured, human and machine-readable format within the C5-DEC
  document-based data store, enabling efficient data retrieval and management.
  4. Thus, I can consistently and efficiently manage, access, and utilize the stored data in varied
  formats without loss of integrity and structure.
