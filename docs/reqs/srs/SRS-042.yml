  As a User,
  I want the data model to accurately encompass and interrelate all entities and documents within the CC ecosystem,
  so that I can efficiently navigate, manage, and derive insights from comprehensive, interconnected CC data,
  ensuring that the manipulation, association, and interpretation of all CC-relevant entities are coherent and traceable.
