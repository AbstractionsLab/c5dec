  As a Developer,
  I want the system to automatically validate relationships, attributes, and dependencies between data points,
  and ensure the completeness of all necessary data entries within the CC data,
  so that development is guided by accurate, reliable, and complete data, thereby reducing the potential for
  errors and rework.
