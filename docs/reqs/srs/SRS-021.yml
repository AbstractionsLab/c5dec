  As a General User, I want a straightforward way to access a CC-specific forum from the Knowledge Base,
  so that I can explore, contribute to, and learn from discussions and interactions within a community
  of CC practitioners and experts.
  1. When I am on the main page or any part of the Knowledge Base, I should easily identify and access
     a link that navigates to a CC-specific forum.
  2. The link directs me to a forum where I can view and participate in discussions related to the
     Common Criteria.
