rationale: "Implementing a support mechanism that assists in generating additional\
  \ evaluation evidence and \nguides for tailoring existing evidence to conform with\
  \ EUCC requirements ensures that the system adheres to \nrelevant regulatory standards\
  \ and efficiently navigates the EUCC evaluation process. This not only \nfosters\
  \ compliance and mitigates regulatory risks but also enhances the robustness and\
  \ credibility of \nthe system by aligning it with established European cybersecurity\
  \ standards and practices.\n"

  As a Security Evaluator, I want the system to implement a support mechanism that assists in
  generating additional evaluation evidence and provides guides for tailoring existing evaluation
  evidence, so that I can ensure that all produced evidence is conformant with EUCC requirements and navigate
  the EUCC evaluation process effectively and efficiently.
