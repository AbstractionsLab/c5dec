rationale: "Maintaining a database that encompasses and integrates diverse and generic\
  \ threats, risks, \nand countermeasures from different standardized sources (like\
  \ BSI Grundschutz, ISO 27005, \nNIST SPs, and the CC) ensures that the system can\
  \ provide a comprehensive and \nstandards-compliant set of data for users or other\
  \ system components dealing with \nsecurity-related aspects. This centralized and\
  \ integrated approach facilitates \nstreamlined, consistent, and efficient handling\
  \ and mitigation of security-related concerns.\n"

  As a General User,I want the system to provide a database that encompasses generic threats,
  risks, and countermeasures, so that I can leverage a comprehensive and integrated source of
  security-related data that assimilates content from BSI Grundschutz, ISO 27005, NIST SPs, and
  the CC, ensuring diverse and standards-compliant support for dealing with security
  considerations in varied contexts.
