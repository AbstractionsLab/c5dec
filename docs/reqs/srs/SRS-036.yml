  As a User,
  I want the system to track and display the evaluation progress of the Evaluation, as well as the
  evaluation status of individual Evaluation Items,
  so that the ongoing status of the Evaluation is clear and easily accessible.

  1. When I load an Evaluation Checklist I expect to see the overall evaluation progress, as well as
  the evaluation status (pass, fail, inconclusive) of each Evaluation Item.
  2. When I select and edit an Evaluation Item I expect the Item's status as well as the overall
  evaluation progress to account for the changes in real time.
