  ## Setup
  1. None
  ## Test steps
  1. Inspect source code 'cct.py' and verify that each '!ELEMENT' in the CC DTD is correctly implemented,
  i.e, verify that:

    - each '!ELEMENT' is implemented as a class object,
    - '#REQUIRED' attributes are implemented as object attributes and populated
    with the object's _build_attributes() method.
    - child elements of each '!ELEMENT' are implemented as object attributes and populated with the object's
    _build_children() method.
    - each object's is_valid() method validates that the required attributes (labelled as
    '#REQUIRED' in the DTD) are (correctly) populated.
    - semantic relationships between CC concepts are preserved in the implementation, i.e., hierarchical and
    dependency relationships between CC concepts are appropriately implemented, e.g., as parent-child relations.
