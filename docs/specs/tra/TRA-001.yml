defect_description: (i) The links in the item preview are empty. E.g., see the preview of family FDP_ACC or of FAU_SAA. (ii) In the item preview of components (e.g. FDP_RIP.2, FDP_ACC.2), the text shown as value for the field "Hierarchical to" is tokenized by characters. Instead, these should be words.
