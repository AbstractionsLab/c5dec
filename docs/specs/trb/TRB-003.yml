  The test execution for the test case (TST) referred in the parent link results in the following observations:

  In the CCT user manual, the part concerning the [ETR creation]
  is confusing:
  - The description reads as if the user _always_ needs to create an evaluation checklist before use this command.
  - The families (and classes) included in the default evaluation checklist could be clarified.
  - A short section describing a simple flow for the 'export'-'etr'-quarto integration would be very helpful.
