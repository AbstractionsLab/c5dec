  Re-execution of test case TST-057 after a code update addressing the
  issues reported in the first testing campaign of the beta release.

  **Notes:** 
  
  - The output path of the spreadsheet (step 2)
  has changed. Instead of `$C5DEC_ROOT/c5dec`, now it is `$C5DEC_ROOT/c5dec/export/`.

  - The parameters `eval-wu-sheet` and `eval-awu-sheet` in step 5 do not need to be commented anymore.

  Evidence is provided in the referred file.
