  ## System requirement specification

  As a User,
  I want the system to validate the hierarchies and dependencies among the selected
  security components,
  so that I can ensure that my set of components is coherent and conforms
  to the CC.

  1. When I select or provide a set of Security Components
  2. Then I expect the system's validation mechanism to check whether the provided component set
  meets the hierarchical and dependency requirements of each selected Security Component.
  3. When I provide an invalid set
  4. Then I expect the system to classify the set as 'invalid' and optionally to provide potential
  valid sets based on the provided selection.
  5. When I provide a valid set
  6. Then I expect the system to classify the set as 'valid'

  ## Acceptance criteria

  1. The system enables the selection or provision of security components for a project.
  2. Upon selection, the system automatically validates the hierarchical and dependency relationships
   among the chosen components, in accordance with CC guidelines.
  3. The system provides clear feedback about the validation status, highlighting any inconsistencies
   or deviations from the CC guidelines.
  4. Adjustments made to the components are accurately reflected and can be re-validated by the system.
