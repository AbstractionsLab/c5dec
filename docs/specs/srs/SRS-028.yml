  ## System requirement specification

  As a Developer,
  I want the system to automatically generate rationales as required by the CC, that captures and
  justifies each parent-child relation,
  so that documentation adheres to CC requirements and maintains a structured and justified linkage
  throughout the development and evaluation processes.
  1. TBD

  ## Acceptance criteria

  - For each created parent-child relationship a rationale is defined.
  - A traceability matrix between all parent-child elements of a given level is automatically generated.
  - A list of justifications, justifying each parent-child link, is automatically compiled.
