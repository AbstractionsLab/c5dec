  ## System requirement specification

  As a General User, I want to traverse through interconnected Articles effortlessly via
  cross-references and hyperlinks, in markdown or exported HTML format, so that I can
  explore related concepts without difficulty.

  Assuming I am viewing a Knowledge Article in the Knowledge Base:

  1. I see hyperlinks or cross-references that guide me to related topics or articles,
   regardless of viewing format (markdown/HTML).
  2. Clicking a hyperlink navigates me to the related topic or article with no broken links
   encountered.
  3. If a linked article is not available, the hyperlink directs me to a standard placeholder
   article that communicates the upcoming availability of the desired content.
  4. I can easily navigate back to the initial article or to other interconnected topics,
   with a clear and user-friendly navigation path.

  ## Acceptance criteria

  - General User can navigate seamlessly between interconnected topics via cross-references
   and hyperlinks, both in markdown and exported HTML format.
  - No broken links are present, ensuring a consistent user experience and unhindered navigation.
  - Links leading to not-yet-available content direct users to a standard placeholder article,
   ensuring a consistent and clear message regarding upcoming content.
  - User can return to the initial KA or navigate to related articles easily, with clear paths
   to navigate back or explore further.
