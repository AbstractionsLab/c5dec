  ## System requirement specification

  As a Developer or Evaluator,
  I want to select a set of Security Assurance Components or Assurance Package and have the system automatically
  generate an Evaluation Checklist, so that I can efficiently assess the evaluation readiness of or evaluate
  a Target of Evaluation.

  1. When I select a set of Security Assurance Components or a pre-defined Assurance Package (e.g. EAL 2)
  to assess the readiness of or to evaluate a Target of Evaluation.
  2. Then I expect the system to automatically validate the selected set of components in terms of the consideration
  of hierarchical and dependency relationships.
  3. When a valid set is selected I want the system to create an Evaluation Checklist based on the selected set.
  4. Then I want to have the option to start the evaluation using the created Evaluation Checklist.

  ## Acceptance criteria

  - User can select and de-select security assurance components or assurance packages (augmentations also allowed)
  - Based on the (valid) selection, a checklist is generated that contains Evaluation Items that correspond to the respective Work Units.
  - Each Evaluation Item contains all relevant information for the Work Unit, i.e., Evaluator Action Element, Content or Developer Element, and the Work Unit task.
  - Furthermore, the User must be able to assign each Evaluation Item an Evaluator, an Evaluation Date, the Evaluation Evidence, and the Evaluation Verdict.
  - An index of required evaluation evidence documentation is created.
