  ## System requirement specification 
  
  As a General User, I want to search and filter the database for Security Component Elements using full-text search and/or attributes.

  Assuming I am logged in as an authorized user:

  1. I access the database containing the CC Security Components.
  2. Then I am able to define a query and search the database.
  3. When I query the database I am provided with best matching results in descending order, from best to worst.
  4. When I select a match, the respective Security Component Element is shown.
  5. Then I can traverse the Security Component structure as defined in SRS-001 or define a new query.
  6. When I define a new query, I resume to Step 3.
  7. At all times I am able to exit the database.

  ## Acceptance criteria

  - General User can access the database.
  - General User can define full-text and/or attributes queries to search the database.
  - General User is successfully presented with search matches in descending order, from best to worst. 
  - General User can select a match to view the respective Security Component Element.
  - General User can traverse the Security Component structure. 
  - General User can define a new query.
