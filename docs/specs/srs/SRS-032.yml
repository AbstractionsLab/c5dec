  ## System requirement specification

  As an Evaluator, I want the system to seamlessly aggregate and present SARs and associated work units,
  aligning them with specific security assurance components,
  so that the process of evaluating the readiness and compliance of a Target of Evaluation (TOE) is
  simplified and streamlined.

  1. When I select an SAR to assess the readiness or compliance of a TOE, I want to see the SAR description and
  the associated Work Unit description.

  ## Acceptance criteria

  - SARs and work units are accurately and seamlessly aggregated by the system.
  - The system displays SARs and work units in an organized manner, aligned with the respective security assurance components.
  - Evaluators can easily navigate and interpret the aggregated data to assess the readiness and compliance of the TOE.
