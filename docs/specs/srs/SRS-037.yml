  ## System requirement specification

  As a User,
  I want to link work units within an Evaluation Checklist to applicable artifacts,
  so that there is clear traceability between work units and related project artifacts.

  1. When I treat an Evaluation Item and hence the associated Work Unit and want to link relevant artifacts to the Evaluation Item/Work Unit.
  2. Then I want to be able to differentiate between linking internal (items stored in the same open file format and managed by C5-DEC) and external artifacts.
  3. When I want to link internal artifacts I can do so by providing the artifact's item UID.
  4. Then I expect the system to acknowledge linking the artifact to the Evaluation Item or inform me (visually) if the UID is invalid.
  5. When I want to link internal artifacts I want to be able to define queries to search for the artifact. (OPTIONAL)
  6 Then I expect the system to provide potentially matching items with a preview of the item's content. (OPTIONAL)
  7 When I select a match I want the system to link the Evaluation Item to the selected item. (OPTIONAL)
  8. When I want to link external artifacts I can do so by providing the path to the external resource.
  9. When I select an Evaluation Item's link
  10. Then I want to be able to modify, remove, or open/preview the linked Item.

  ## Acceptance criteria

  - Users can create, modify, and remove links between work units and applicable artifacts.
  - Links are visibly represented and can be navigated within the system.
  - Links are differentiated between internal and external links.
