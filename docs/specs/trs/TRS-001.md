## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: aligned with test case specifications
- Hardware deviations: aligned with test case specifications

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Clone repository

- ?c5-defect-0

**Test case step 2**: Start Docker Desktop

- ?c5-defect-0: Docker Desktop was already running

**Test case step 3**: Open the C5-DEC repository in VS Code

- ?c5-defect-0

**Test case step 4**: Reopen in container with options

- ?c5-defect-0: the pop-up "Reopen in Container" appeared. When clicked, the two expected options (shown in the test case image) were presented in VS Code

**Test case step 5**: Build the CAD dev container

- ?c5-defect-0: the image was created without errors when selecting the `C5-DEC CAD dev container` option

**Test case step 6**: Open a terminal and a shell

- ?c5-defect-0: a terminal and a poetry shell were manually created. The expected outcome is in alignment with the expected outcome shown in TSS-001.
