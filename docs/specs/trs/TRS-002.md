## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: aligned with test case specifications
- Hardware deviations: aligned with test case specifications

## Test execution results

**Test case step 1**: Clone repository

- ?c5-defect-0

**Test case step 2**: Open the C5-DEC repository in VS Code

- ?c5-defect-0

**Test case step 3**: Reopen in container with options

- ?c5-defect-0: the pop-up "Reopen in Container" appeared. When clicked, the two expected options (shown in the test case image) were presented in VS Code

**Test case step 4**: Build the CAD dev container

- ?c5-defect-0: when selecting the `C5-DEC CAD dev container` option, the image was created without errors after approx. 3-4 minutes

**Test case step 5**: Open a terminal and a shell
