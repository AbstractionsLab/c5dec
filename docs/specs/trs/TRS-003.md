# TCER: PQ cryptography container

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: aligned with test case specifications
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

**Test case step 1**: Clone the C5-DEC repository

- ?c5-defect-0

**Test case step 2**: Open the project in VS Code

- ?c5-defect-0

**Test case step 3**: Reopen in container with the option "C5-DEC cryptography dev container"

- ?c5-defect-0: the container is opened successfully

**Test case step 4**: Get a list of the available quantum-safe signature algorithms

- ?c5-defect-0: the output list corresponds to the expected outcome described in TSS-003

**Test case step 5**: Get a list of the available quantum-safe KEM algorithms

- ?c5-defect-0: the list of the available quantum-safe KEM algorithms corresponds to the expected outcome described in TSS-003

### Defect summary description

Defect-free test execution, i.e., defect category: ?c5-defect-0

### Text execution evidence

See linked files (if any), e.g., screenshots, logs, etc.

### Comments

If we want to open the 'C5-DEC cryptography dev container' while already in VS Code and using the C5-DEC CAD container, the "Reopen in Container" option is not available. This happens more generally when trying to switch between the two C5-DEC containers.

However, this behavior is not related with C5-DEC but with the VS Code dev containers extension. The workaround is to "Reopen folder locally" for the "Reopen in Container" option to become available again.
