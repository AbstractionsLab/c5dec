# TCER: Test DocEngine

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: aligned with test case specification
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

**Test case step 1**: Open the C5-DEC CAD container in VS Code and activate the Python environment in the root folder

- ?c5-defect-0

**Test case step 2**: Go to the execution path of C5DEC CAD

- ?c5-defect-0

**Test case step 3**: Use `quarto` to render a PDF document

- ?c5-defect-0: the quarto command run successfully without showing error messages in the terminal; the PDF file was generated in the folder `~/c5dec/assets/report/_output/C5-DEC-CAD-DocEngine.pdf`.

### Defect summary description

Defect-free test execution, i.e., defect category: ?c5-defect-0

### Text execution evidence

See the file referred below in this test case report.

### Comments

The final message in the terminal indicates `Output created: _output/C5-DEC-CAD-DocEngine.pdf`.
While this path is correct w.r.t to the root of the quarto project, it is not correct w.r.t. to the execution path and it might be confusing. If the implementation effort is minimal, it would be better to show the complete path, i.e., `~/c5dec/assets/report/_output/C5-DEC-CAD-DocEngine.pdf`.
