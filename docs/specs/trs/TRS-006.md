# TCER: build and run an empty created project

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: aligned with test case specification
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

**Test case step 1**: Go to the `myproject` folder

- ?c5-defect-0

**Test case step 2**: Run the build script

- ?c5-defect-0: the log showed a healthy built of the images `myproject:v1.0` and `myproject-dev:v1.0`
```

```

**Test case step 3**: Verify that the images exist

- ?c5-defect-0: the images `myproject-dev` and `myproject`, each with tag `v1.0` appear in the output of the executed command
```
REPOSITORY                               TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
myproject-dev                            v1.0      cf96ad7b07c3   13 minutes ago   3.12GB
myproject                                v1.0      c8a9121fa2a7   14 minutes ago   1.86GB
```

**Test case step 4**: Run the help of `myproject`

- ?c5-defect-0: the command showed the following output:
```
~/myproject % ./myproject.sh help
Starting myproject...
For usage instructions, run: ./myproject.sh help
---
./myproject.sh
... to open the myproject CLI help menu
./myproject.sh session
... to start an interactive myproject session
./myproject.sh <command>
... to run a myproject CLI command
./myproject.sh <command> -h
... to get help for a myproject CLI command
---
```

**Test case step 5**: Run `myproject` in a container

- ?c5-defect-0: an interactive shell within the container was created for the default user:
```
~/myproject % ./myproject.sh session
Starting myproject...
For usage instructions, run: ./myproject.sh help
Launching an interactive myproject session...
user@f8e418686013:~/myproject/myproject$ 
```

**Test case step 6**: Dependencies correctly installed

- ?c5-defect-0: the version of doorstop corresponds with the expected outcome for step 6 in TSS-006.

**Test case step 7**: Exit the session

- ?c5-defect-0: the container shell was closed and the control was given back to the terminal shell
