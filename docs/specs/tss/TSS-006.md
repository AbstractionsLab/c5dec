# TC: Test build and run of new project via scripts
Verify that the scripts of a new project created by c5dec successfully build an image of the new project and can run a default interactive session.

## Preconditions
- Access to the C5-DEC deployment artifacts obtained from the Git repository
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) (or daemon or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)) running with the right privileges for the testing user
- A terminal running a shell (e.g., bash, zsh)

### Test dependencies
- **TSS-005** executed successfully

## Setup actions
To keep a clean separation of the tested artifact, copy or move the unzipped project created during the execution of TSS-005 to a location of your choice outside the C5-DEC project folder. This location will be referred as the `test_root` folder.

## Test steps
1. Go to the `test_root` folder and then to `myproject`: `cd test_root/myproject`
2. Build the project using the build script: 
```sh
./build-myproject.sh
```
3. Verify that the images `myproject:v1.0` and `myproject-dev:v1.0` have been created
```sh
docker images
```
4. Run the help menu of the project
```sh
./myproject.sh help
```
5. Create a container of the image built in 3 and open an interactive shell.
```sh
./myproject.sh session
```
6. Verify that doorstop is installed
```sh
doorstop -V
```
7. Exit the container session
```sh
exit
```

## Expected outcome
2. The command execution finishes showing a log without errors.
3. The docker images `myproject-dev` and `myproject-dev` with tag `v1.0` appear in the list of images.
4. An informative text with the available commands is shown in the terminal.
5. An interactive shell inside a docker container is opened.
5. `Doorstop v3.0b9` is shown as the output.
6. The system shell appears back in the terminal.
