  ## Setup:
  1. None
  ## Test steps:
  1. Export CC Document stored in the internal data representation to XML (cc_export1.xml)
  2. Validate the exported XML against the CC DTD.
  3. Load the exported and validated XML into the internal data representation.
  4. Again export the loaded CC Document to XML (cc_export2.xml) and validate against the CC DTD.
  5. Repeat if desired.
  6. Verify that all _exported_ XMLs are identical.

  Note: Exported XML files will differ from the official CC XML since irrelevant information (e.g., patchinfos
  legalnotice, pagebreaks, biblioentries, glossentries, etc.) are ignored.
