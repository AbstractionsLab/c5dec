  ## Test steps
  Run the following commands and validate the corresponding described output:

  1. `c5dec export chckComp3R5 3R5 -p ACO_REL.1`: the evaluation checklist for component ACO_REL.1 of CCv3.1R5 
      is created in a spreadsheet at `$C5DEC_ROOT/c5dec`
  2. `c5dec export chckComp3R5 3R5 -p ALC_COMP.1`: ALC_COMP.1 does not exist in CCv3.1R5, thus an error message is shown.
