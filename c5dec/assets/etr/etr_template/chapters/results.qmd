# Evaluation results {#sec-evalResults}
Based on the analysis presented in @sec-detailedEv, the evaluation results are summarized next.

## Overall assessment and verdict

:::{.callout-note title="Life cycle verdict"}
[Inconclusive]{style="color:orange;"}
:::

The overall verdict is {{< var verdict.pass >}} if and only if all the constituent verdicts are also {{< var verdict.pass >}}. If the verdict for one evaluator action element is {{< var verdict.fail >}}, then the verdicts for the corresponding assurance component, assurance class, and overall verdict are also {{< var verdict.fail >}}.

All verdicts are initially {{< var verdict.inclsv >}} and remain so until either a {{< var verdict.pass >}} or {{< var verdict.fail >}} verdict is assigned.

If all work units are met, because all assurance requirements to be examined in this report have a positive evaluation result ({{< var verdict.pass >}}), the entire evaluation aspect, i.e., here the Life Cycle Assurance Class (ALC), is assigned a {{< var verdict.pass >}} verdict. Similarly, a work unit is passed all its associated audit actions pass.

A work unit is assigned a {{< var verdict.fail >}} verdict if at least one of its audit actions results in a {{< var verdict.fail >}} verdict. Similarly, an assurance component and evaluation action are assigned a {{< var verdict.fail >}} verdict if one of their work units is assigned a {{< var verdict.fail >}} verdict.

An overall {{< var verdict.fail >}} verdict for a class such as life cycle (ALC) means that the TOE does not fulfil at least a requirement of the Assurance Components of one of the following families: ALC_CMC, ALC_CMS, ALC_DEL, ALC_DVS, ALC_LCD, and ALC_TAT. Assurance requirements pertaining to the flaw remediation family (ALC_FLR) are evaluated separately.

### Result overview

| Evaluation aspect   | Result                   |
|:--------------------|:-------------------------|
| ALC_CMC.4-1         | Pass                     |

Overall, only $M$ out of $N$ evaluation work units are assigned a {{< var verdict.pass >}} verdict, with the evaluation of all other work units yielding an {{< var verdict.inclsv >}} result due to either missing or insufficiently detailed evidence.

In terms of the audit actions derived from the above-mentioned work units, $p$ out of $q$ are assigned a {{< var verdict.pass >}} verdict, with all the remaining audition actions yielding an {{< var verdict.inclsv >}} result due to either missing or insufficiently detailed evidence.

## Indications for potential vulnerabilities

Here we report potential vulnerabilities suspected during the ALC assessment.

## Missing information
