## Life-cycle definition: Developer defined life-cycle model (ALC_LCD.1) {#sec-lcd}

A life-cycle definition establishes the engineering practices used by a developer to produce the TOE. Conformance to a defined life-cycle model for the development and maintenance of the TOE is a security practice aimed at preventing the introduction of vulnerabilities in the implementation derived from a lack of or poor control over such processes.

### Evaluation action (ALC_LCD.1.1E)

The objective of this sub-activity is to determine whether the developer has used a documented model of the TOE life-cycle.

### Content and evidence requirements

General requirements for the evaluation of this aspect are:

a. the ST;
b. the life-cycle definition documentation.
