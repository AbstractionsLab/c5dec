# FCS Cryptographic support

The TSF may employ cryptographic functionality to help satisfy several high-level security objectives. These include, but are not limited to: identification and authentication, non-repudiation, trusted path, trusted channel, and data separation. This class is used when the TOE implements cryptographic functions, the implementation of which can be in hardware, firmware and/or software. The FCS: Cryptographic support class is composed of four families.
Figure 17 shows the decomposition of this class, it's families and components. Elements are not shown in the figure.
Annex E provides explanatory information for this class and should be consulted when using the components identified in this class.
