# FIA_AFL.1 Authentication failure handling

FIA_AFL.1 Authentication failure handling, requires that the TSF be able to terminate the session establishment process after a specified number of unsuccessful user authentication attempts. It also requires that, after termination of the session establishment process, the TSF be able to disable the user account or the point of entry from which the attempts were made until an administrator-defined condition occurs.
