# FDP_IFF.2 Hierarchical security attributes

FDP_IFF.2 Hierarchical security attributes expands on the requirements of FDP_IFF.1 Simple security attributes by requiring that all information flow control SFPs in the set of SFRs use hierarchical security attributes that form a lattice (as defined in mathematics). FDP_IFF.2.6 is derived from the mathematical properties of a lattice. A lattice consists of a set of elements with an ordering relationship with the property defined in the first bullet, a least upper bound which is the unique element in the set that is greater than or equal to (in the ordering relationship) than any other element of the lattice, and a greatest lower bound, which is the unique element in the set that is smaller than or equal to than any other element of the lattice.
