# FAU_SAA.2 Profile based anomaly detection

In FAU_SAA.2 Profile based anomaly detection, the TSF maintains individual profiles of system usage, where a profile represents the historical patterns of usage performed by members of the profile target group. A profile target group refers to a group of one or more individuals who interact with the TSF. Each member of a profile target group is assigned an individual suspicion rating that represents how well that memberÂ´s current activity corresponds to the established patterns of usage represented in the profile. This analysis can be performed at runtime or during a post-collection batch-mode analysis.
