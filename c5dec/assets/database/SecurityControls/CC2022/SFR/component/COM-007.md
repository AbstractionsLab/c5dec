# FAU_SAA.4 Complex attack heuristics

In FAU_SAA.4 Complex attack heuristics, the TSF shall be able to represent and detect multi-step intrusion scenarios. The TSF is able to compare system events (possibly performed by multiple individuals) against event sequences known to represent entire intrusion scenarios. The TSF shall be able to indicate when a signature event or event sequence is found that indicates a potential violation of the enforcement of the SFRs.
