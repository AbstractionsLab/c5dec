# FCS_RBG.1 Random bit generation (RBG)

FCS_RBG.1 Random bit generation (RBG) requires random bit generation to be performed in accordance with selected standards. It also specifies whether the initial seeding is done via an internal or external noise source, as well as when and how an RBG’s state is updated.
