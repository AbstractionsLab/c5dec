  The “Information retention control” family addresses a basic need in secure information processing and storage applications for the secure management of data no longer needed by the TOE to perform its operations, but that is still stored in the TOE. The historical view of IT systems as data storage systems suggested that once entered, data would seldom be deleted from the system, and if it was deleted, this would mainly be because of storage exhaustion problems. However, in a multilateral or high security environment it is important to minimize the replication of data, as well as the time period during which data is stored in the system. It is also possible that users can want their IT products to avoid retaining sensitive data that they consider to be exploitable by third parties or that can threaten privacy. FDP_IRC may help users to gain confidence that the product is secure by deleting every copy of the data when it is no longer needed. The FDP_RIP “Residual information protection” family addresses one side of this problem, but an explicit requirement on the management of data that is no longer needed is missing. Of course, competing requirements can arise, since some data can be needed by the system for more operations over a longer time period. Possible solutions to this problem are: - better protecting the information objects stored in the TOE from access; - re-requesting the protected information from the user each time it is needed. Information retention control ensures, that data no longer necessary for the operation of the TOE is deleted by the TOE. Components of this family require the author of a PP, PP-Module, functional package or ST to identify the TOE operations, including both simple and complex processing and the information objects, that are not to be kept in the TOE, that are the subject of those operations. The TOE is also required to keep track of such stored information objects, and to delete both the on-line and the off-line information objects that are no longer required. This family sets only requirements on information objects requested for specific activities in the TOE operation, and not on general data gathering. The policies which control the collection, storage, processing, disclosure, and elimination of general user data stored on the TOE are detailed elsewhere, and are in the domain of the environmental objectives and organizational policies, not of the PP, PP-Module, functional package or ST. When more than one operation requires the presence of a protected object, all operations, which refer to the required object, shall end before deleting it.
