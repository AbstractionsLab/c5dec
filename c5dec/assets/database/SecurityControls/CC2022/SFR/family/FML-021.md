  This family provides requirements that address protection of user data when it is transferred between separated parts of a TOE across an internal channel. This may be contrasted with the Inter-TSF user data confidentiality transfer protection (FDP_UCT) and Inter-TSF user data integrity transfer protection (FDP_UIT) families, which provide protection for user data when it is transferred between distinct TSFs across an external channel, and Export from the TOE (FDP_ETC) and Import from outside of the TOE (FDP_ITC), which address TSF-mediated transfer of data to or from outside the TOE.
