  This family allows the specification of the management functions to be provided by the TOE. Management functions provide TSFI that allow administrators to define the parameters that control the operation of security-related aspects of the TOE, such as data protection attributes, TOE protection attributes, audit attributes, and identification and authentication attributes. Management functions also include those functions performed by an operator to ensure continued operation of the TOE, such as backup and recovery. This family works in conjunction with the other components in the FMT: Security management class: the component in this family calls out the management functions, and other families in FMT: Security management restricts the ability to use these management functions.
