  The family FPT_EMS (TOE Emanation) of the class FPT (Protection of the TSF) describes the IT SFRs of the TOE related to leakage of information based on emanation. If the TOE must prevent attacks against the TOE and secret data processed by the TOE where the attack is based on external observable phenomena of the TOE during its operation, different types of emissions and interfaces of the TOE as well as different types of TSF data and user data can be addressed. EXAMPLE Examples of such attacks against the TOE and its processed secret data are simple power analysis (SPA), differential power analysis (DPA), simple electromagnetic analysis (SEMA), differential electromagnetic analysis (DEMA), timing attacks, padding oracle attacks, cache miss attacks. This family describes the functional requirements for the limitation of intelligible emanations which are not directly addressed by any other component of this document.
