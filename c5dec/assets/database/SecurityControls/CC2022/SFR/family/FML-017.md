  This family identifies the information flow control SFPs (by name) and defines the scope of control for each named information flow control SFP. This scope of control is characterized by three sets: the subjects under control of the policy, the information under control of the policy, and operations which cause controlled information to flow to and from controlled subjects covered by the policy. The criteria allow multiple policies to exist, each having a unique name. This is accomplished by iterating components from this family once for each named information flow control policy. The rules that define the functionality of an information flow control SFP will be defined by other families such as Information flow control functions (FDP_IFF) and Export from the TOE (FDP_ETC). The names of the information flow control SFPs identified here in Information flow control policy (FDP_IFC) are meant to be used throughout the remainder of the functional components that have an operation that calls for an assignment or selection of an “information flow control SFP.” The TSF mechanism controls the flow of information in accordance with the information flow control SFP. Operations that would change the security attributes of information are not generally permitted as this would be in violation of an information flow control SFP. However, such operations may be permitted as exceptions to the information flow control SFP if explicitly specified.
