Acronym: FPT_TRC
Behaviour: |
  The requirements of this family are needed to ensure the consistency of TSF data when such data is replicated internal to the TOE. Such data can become inconsistent if the internal channel between parts of the TOE becomes inoperative. If the TOE is internally structured as a network and parts of the TOE network connections are broken, this can occur when parts become disabled.
