Acronym: FCS_CKM
Behaviour: |
  Cryptographic keys must be managed throughout their life cycle. This family is intended to support that lifecycle and consequently defines requirements for the following activities: - cryptographic key generation; - cryptographic key distribution; - cryptographic key access; - cryptographic key derivation; - timing and event of cryptographic key destruction. This family should be included whenever there are functional requirements for the management of cryptographic keys.
