Acronym: FDP_ACC

  This family identifies the access control SFPs (by name) and defines the scope of control of the policies that form the identified access control portion of the SFRs related to the SFP. This scope of control is characterized by three sets: the subjects under control of the policy, the objects under control of the policy, and the operations among controlled subjects and controlled objects that are covered by the policy. The criteria allow multiple policies to exist, each having a unique name. This is accomplished by iterating components from this family once for each named access control policy. The rules that define the functionality of an access control SFP will be defined by other families such as Access control functions (FDP_ACF) and Export from the TOE (FDP_ETC). The names of the access control SFPs identified here in Access control policy (FDP_ACC) are meant to be used throughout the remainder of the functional components that have an operation that calls for an assignment or selection of an “access control SFP.”
