# FDP_RIP Residual information protection

This family addresses the need to ensure that any data contained in a resource is not available when the resource is de-allocated from one object and reallocated to a different object. This family requires protection for any data contained in a resource that has been logically deleted or released but may still be present within the TSF-controlled resource which in turn may be re-allocated to another object.
