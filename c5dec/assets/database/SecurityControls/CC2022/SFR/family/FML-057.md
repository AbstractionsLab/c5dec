  Distributed TOEs can give rise to greater complexity than monolithic TOEs through the potential for differences in state between parts of the TOE, and through delays in communication. In most cases synchronization of state between distributed functions involves an exchange protocol, not a simple action. When malice exists in the distributed environment of these protocols, more complex defensive protocols are required. State synchrony protocol (FPT_SSP) establishes the requirement for certain critical functions of the TSF to use this trusted protocol. State synchrony protocol (FPT_SSP) ensures that two distributed parts of the TOE have synchronized their states after a security-relevant action.
