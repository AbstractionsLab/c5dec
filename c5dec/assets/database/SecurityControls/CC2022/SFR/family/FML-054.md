  TSF physical protection components refer to restrictions on unauthorized physical access to the TSF, and to the deterrence of, and resistance to, unauthorized physical modification, or substitution of the TSF. The requirements of components in this family ensure that the TSF is protected from physical tampering and interference. Satisfying the requirements of these components results in the TSF being packaged and used in such a manner that physical tampering is detectable, or resistance to physical tampering is enforced. Without these components, the protection functions of a TSF lose their effectiveness in environments where physical damage cannot be prevented. This family also provides requirements regarding how the TSF shall respond to physical tampering attempts.
