  This family describes the rules for the specific functions that can implement the information flow control SFPs named in Information flow control policy (FDP_IFC), which also specifies the scope of control of the policy. It consists of two kinds of requirements: one addressing the common information flow function issues, and a second addressing illicit information flows (i.e. covert channels). This division arises because the issues concerning illicit information flows are, in some sense, orthogonal to the rest of an information flow control SFP. By their nature, they circumvent the information flow control SFP resulting in a violation of the policy. As such, they require special functions to either limit or prevent their occurrence.
