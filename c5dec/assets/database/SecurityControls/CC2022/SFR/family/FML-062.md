Acronym: FPT_TST
Behaviour: |
  The family defines the requirements for the self-testing of the TSF with respect to some expected correct operation. Examples are interfaces to enforcement functions, and sample arithmetical operations on critical parts of the TOE. These tests can be carried out at start-up, periodically, at the request of the authorized user, or when other conditions are met. The actions to be taken by the TOE as the result of self-testing are defined in other families. The requirements of this family are also needed to detect the corruption of TSF data and TSF itself (i.e. TSF executable code or TSF hardware component) by various failures that do not necessarily stop the TOEÂ´s operation (which would be handled by other families). These checks need to be performed because these failures cannot necessarily be prevented. Such failures can occur either because of unforeseen failure modes or associated oversights in the design of hardware, firmware, or software, or because of malicious corruption of the TSF due to inadequate logical and/or physical protection.
