  Data authentication permits an entity to accept responsibility for the authenticity of information. This family provides a method of providing a guarantee of the validity of a specific unit of data that can be subsequently used to verify that the information content has not been forged or fraudulently modified. In contrast to FAU: Security audit, this family is intended to be applied to "static" data rather than data that is being transferred.
