# FDP_ETC Export from the TOE

This family defines functions for TSF-mediated exporting of user data from the TOE such that its security attributes and protection either can be explicitly preserved or can be ignored once it has been exported. It is concerned with limitations on export and with the association of security attributes with the exported user data.
