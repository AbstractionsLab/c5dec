# FRU Resource utilization

This class provides three families that support the availability of required resources such as processing capability and/or storage capacity. The family Fault Tolerance provides protection against unavailability of capabilities caused by failure of the TOE. The family Priority of Service ensures that the resources will be allocated to the more important or time-critical tasks and cannot be monopolized by lower priority tasks. The family Resource Allocation provides limits on the use of available resources, therefore preventing users from monopolizing the resources.

Figure 77 shows the decomposition of this class, it's families and components. Elements are not shown in the figure.
Annex K provides explanatory information for this class and should be consulted when using the components identified in this class.
