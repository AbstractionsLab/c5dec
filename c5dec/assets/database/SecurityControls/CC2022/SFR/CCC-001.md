<b>General information about audit requirements<b>\n
The audit families allow PP, PP-Module, functional package or ST authors the ability to define requirements for monitoring user activities and, in some cases, detecting real, possible, or imminent violations of the enforcement of the SFRs. The TOE's security audit functions are defined to help monitor security-relevant events, and act as a deterrent against security violations. The requirements of the audit families refer to functions that include audit data protection, record format, and event selection, as well as analysis tools, violation alarms, and real-time analysis. The audit records may be presented in human-readable format either directly or indirectly or both.\n
While developing the security audit requirements, the author of a PP, PP-Module, functional package or ST should take note of the inter-relationships among the audit families and components. The potential exists to specify a set of audit requirements that conform with the family/component dependencies lists, while at the same time resulting in a deficient audit function.\n

<b>Audit requirements in a distributed environment<b>\n
The implementation of audit requirements for networks and other large systems can differ significantly from those needed for stand-alone systems. Larger, more complex, and active systems require more thought concerning which audit data to collect and how this can be managed, due to the lowered feasibility of interpreting (or even storing) what gets collected. The traditional notion of a time-ordered list, set of records or 'trail' of audited events is not always applicable in a global asynchronous network with many arbitrary events occurring at once.\n
Also, different hosts and servers on a distributed TOE can have differing naming policies and values. Further, the use of symbolic names for audit review requires a net-wide convention to avoid redundancies and 'name clashes.`\n`
A multi-object audit repository, portions of which are accessible by a potentially wide variety of authorized users, are usually required if audit repositories are to serve a useful function in distributed systems.
Finally, misuse of authority by authorized users can be addressed by systematically avoiding local storage of audit data pertaining to administrator actions.

# FAU Security Audit

Security auditing involves recognizing, recording, storing, and analyzing information related to security relevant activities (i.e. activities controlled by the TSF). The resulting audit records can be examined to determine which security relevant activities took place and whom (which user) is responsible for them. Annex C provides explanatory information for this class and should be consulted when using the components identified in this class.
