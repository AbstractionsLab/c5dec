# FCO Communication

This class provides two families specifically concerned with assuring the identity of a party participating in a data exchange. These families are related to assuring the identity of the originator of transmitted information (proof of origin) and assuring the identity of the recipient of transmitted information (proof of receipt). These families ensure that an originator cannot deny having sent the message, nor can the recipient deny having received it.
Figure 14 shows the decomposition of the class. Figure 14 shows the decomposition of this class, it's families and components. Elements are not shown in the figure. Annex D provides explanatory information for this class and should be consulted when using the components identified in this class.
