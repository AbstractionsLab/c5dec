# FIA Identification and authentication

Families in this class address the requirements for functions to establish and verify a claimed user identity. Identification and authentication are required to ensure that users are associated with the proper security attributes The unambiguous identification of authorized users and the correct association of security attributes with users and subjects is critical to the enforcement of the intended security policies. The families in this class deal with determining and verifying the identity of users, determining their authority to interact with the TOE, and with the correct association of security attributes for each authorized user. Other classes of requirements are dependent upon correct identification and authentication of users in order to be effective.
Figure 38 shows the decomposition of this class, it's families and components. Elements are not shown in the figure.
