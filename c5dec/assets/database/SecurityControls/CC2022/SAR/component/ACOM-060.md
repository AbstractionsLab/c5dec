AppNotes: |
  ALC_CMS.4.1C introduces the requirement that reports of identified security flaws be included in the configuration list and hence be subject to the CM requirements of CM capabilities (ALC_CMC). This requires that information regarding previously identified security flaw reports and their resolution be maintained.
Dependencies: ''
Id: ALC_CMS.4
Name: Problem tracking CM coverage
Objectives: |
  A CM system can control changes only to those items that have been placed under CM (i.e. the configuration items identified in the configuration list). Placing the TOE itself, the parts that comprise the TOE, the TOE implementation representation and the evaluation evidence required by the other SARs under CM provides assurance that they have been modified in a controlled manner with proper authorisations. Placing security flaw reports under CM ensures that the integrity of the reports is maintained and that access to them is managed, further, it may support developers in tracking security flaws to their resolution.
