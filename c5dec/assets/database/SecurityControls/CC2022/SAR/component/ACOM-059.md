AppNotes: |
  ALC_CMS.3.1C introduces the requirement that the TOE implementation representation be included in the list of configuration items and hence be subject to the CM requirements of CM capabilities (ALC_CMC).
Dependencies: ''
Id: ALC_CMS.3
Name: Implementation representation CM coverage
Objectives: |
  A CM system can control changes only to those items that have been placed under CM (i.e. the configuration items identified in the configuration list). Placing the TOE itself, the parts that comprise the TOE, the TOE implementation representation and the evaluation evidence required by the other SARs under CM provides assurance that they have been modified in a controlled manner with proper authorisations.
