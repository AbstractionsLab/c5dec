AppNotes: |
  Judgements on the adequacy of the structure and complexity are expected to be derived from the specific technologies used in the TOE. This component calls for identifying the standards for measuring the structure and complexity.
Dependencies: |
  ADV_IMP.1 Implementation representation of the TSF, ADV_TDS.3 Basic modular design, ALC_TAT.1 Well-defined development tools
Id: ADV_INT.3
Name: Minimally complex internals
Objectives: |
  The objective of this component is to provide a means for requiring the TSF to be well-structured and of minimal complexity. The intent is that the entire TSF has been designed and implemented using sound engineering principles.
