AppNotes: |
  This component does not address the use of developer test results. It is applicable where such results are not available, and also in cases where the developerÂ´s testing is accepted without validation. The evaluator is required to devise and conduct tests with the objective of confirming that the TOE operates in accordance with its design representations, including but not limited to the functional specification. The approach is to gain confidence in correct operation through representative testing, rather than to conduct every possible test. The extent of testing to be planned for this purpose is a methodology issue, and needs to be considered in the context of a particular TOE and the balance of other evaluation activities.
