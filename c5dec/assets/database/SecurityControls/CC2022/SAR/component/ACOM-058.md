AppNotes: |
  ALC_CMS.2.1C introduces the requirement that the parts that comprise the TOE (all parts that are delivered to the consumer, for example hardware parts or executable files) be included in the configuration list and hence be subject to the CM requirements of CM capabilities (ALC_CMC). ALC_CMS.2.3C introduces the requirement that the configuration list indicate the developer of each TSF relevant configuration item.
Dependencies: ''
Id: ALC_CMS.2
Name: Parts of the TOE CM coverage
Objectives: |
  A CM system can control changes only to those items that have been placed under CM (i.e. the configuration items identified in the configuration list). Placing the TOE itself, the parts that comprise the TOE, and the evaluation evidence required by the other SARs under CM provides assurance that they have been modified in a controlled manner with proper authorisations.
