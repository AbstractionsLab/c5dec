AppNotes: |
  ALC_CMS.5.1C introduces the requirement that development tools and other related information be included in the list of configuration items and hence be subject to the CM requirements of CM capabilities (ALC_CMC). Examples of development tools are programming languages and compilers. Information pertaining to TOE generation items (such as compiler options, generation options, and build options) is an example of information relating to development tools.

Id: ALC_CMS.5
Name: Development tools CM coverage
Objectives: |
  A CM system can control changes only to those items that have been placed under CM (i.e. the configuration items identified in the configuration list). Placing the TOE itself, the parts that comprise the TOE, the TOE implementation representation and the evaluation evidence required by the other SARs under CM provides assurance that they have been modified in a controlled manner with proper authorisations. Placing security flaw reports under CM ensures that the integrity of the reports is maintained and that access to them is managed, further, it may support developers in tracking security flaws to their resolution. Development tools play an important role in ensuring the production of a quality version of the TOE. Therefore, it is important to control modifications to these tools.
