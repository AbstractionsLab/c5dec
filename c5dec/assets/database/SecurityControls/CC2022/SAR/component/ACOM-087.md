AppNotes: |
  The intent is that the developer should provide the evaluator with materials necessary for the efficient reproduction of developer tests. This may include such things as machine-readable test documentation, test programs, etc. This component contains a requirement that the evaluator has available test results from the developer to supplement the programme of testing. The evaluator will repeat a sample of the developer´s tests to gain confidence in the results obtained. Having established such confidence the evaluator will build upon the developer´s testing by conducting additional tests that exercise the TOE in a different manner. By using a platform of validated developer test results the evaluator is able to gain confidence that the TOE operates correctly in a wider range of conditions than would be possible purely using the developer´s own efforts, given a fixed level of resource. Having gained confidence that the developer has tested the TOE, the evaluator will also have more freedom, where appropriate, to concentrate testing in areas where examination of documentation or specialist knowledge has raised particular concerns.

Name: Independent testing - sample
Objectives: |
  In this component, the objective is to demonstrate that the TOE operates in accordance with its design representations and guidance documents. Evaluator testing confirms that the developer performed some tests of some interfaces in the functional specification.
