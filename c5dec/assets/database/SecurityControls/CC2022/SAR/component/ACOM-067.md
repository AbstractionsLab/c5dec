Name: Systematic flaw remediation
Objectives: |
  In order for the developer to be able to act appropriately upon security flaw reports from TOE users, and to know to whom to send corrective fixes, TOE users need to understand how to submit security flaw reports to the developer, and how to register themselves with the developer so that they may receive these corrective fixes. Flaw remediation guidance from the developer to the TOE user ensures that TOE users are aware of this important information.
