AppNotes: |
  ALC_CMS.1.1C introduces the requirement that the TOE itself and the evaluation evidence required by the other SARs in the ST be included in the configuration list and hence be subject to the CM requirements of CM capabilities (ALC_CMC).
Dependencies: ''
Id: ALC_CMS.1
Name: TOE CM coverage
Objectives: |
  A CM system can control changes only to those items that have been placed under CM (i.e. the configuration items identified in the configuration list). Placing the TOE itself and the evaluation evidence required by the other SARs in the ST under CM provides assurance that they have been modified in a controlled manner with proper authorisations.
