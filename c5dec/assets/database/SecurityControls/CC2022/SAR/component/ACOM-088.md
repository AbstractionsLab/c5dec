AppNotes: |
  The intent is that the developer should provide the evaluator with materials necessary for the efficient reproduction of developer tests. This may include, e.g. machine-readable test documentation, test programs. In this component the evaluator must repeat all of the developerÂ´s tests as part of the programme of testing. As in the previous component the evaluator will also conduct tests that aim to exercise the TSF in a different manner from that achieved by the developer. In cases where developer testing has been exhaustive, there may remain little scope for this.
