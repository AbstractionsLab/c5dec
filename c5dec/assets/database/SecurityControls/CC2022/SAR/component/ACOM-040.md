AppNotes: |
  Judgements on the adequacy of the structure are expected to be derived from the specific technologies used in the TOE. This component calls for identifying the standards for measuring the characteristic of being well-structured.
Dependencies: |
  ADV_IMP.1 Implementation representation of the TSF, ADV_TDS.3 Basic modular design, ALC_TAT.1 Well-defined development tools
Id: ADV_INT.2
Name: Well-structured internals
Objectives: |
  The objective of this component is to provide a means for requiring the TSF to be well-structured. The intent is that the entire TSF has been designed and implemented using sound engineering principles.
