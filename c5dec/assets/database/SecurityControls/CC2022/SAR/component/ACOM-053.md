Name: Use of the CM system
Objectives: |
  A unique reference is required to ensure that there is no ambiguity in terms of which instance of the TOE is being evaluated. Labelling the TOE with its reference ensures that users of the TOE can be aware of which instance of the TOE they are using. Unique identification of the configuration items leads to a clearer understanding of the composition of the TOE, which in turn helps to determine those items which are subject to the evaluation requirements for the TOE. The use of a CM system increases assurance that the configuration items are maintained in a controlled manner.
