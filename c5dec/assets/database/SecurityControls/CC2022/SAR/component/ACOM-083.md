Id: ATE_DPT.4
Name: 'Testing: implementation representation'
Objectives: |
  The subsystem and module descriptions of the TSF provide a high-level description of the internal workings, and a description of the interfaces of the modules, of the TSF. Testing at this level of TOE description provides assurance that the TSF subsystems and modules behave and interact as described in the TOE design and the security architecture description, and in accordance with the implementation representation.
