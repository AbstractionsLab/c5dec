  ADV_ARC.1 Security architecture description, ADV_TDS.3 Basic modular design, ATE_FUN.1 Functional testing
Id: ATE_DPT.2
Name: 'Testing: security enforcing modules'
Objectives: |
  The subsystem and module descriptions of the TSF provide a high-level description of the internal workings, and a description of the interfaces of the SFR-enforcing modules, of the TSF. Testing at this level of TOE description provides assurance that the TSF subsystems and SFR-enforcing modules behave and interact as described in the TOE design and the security architecture description.
