# ACE Protection Profile Configuration evaluation

Evaluating a PP-Configuration is required to demonstrate that the PP-Configuration is sound and consistent. These properties are necessary for the PP-Configuration to be suitable for use as the basis for writing an ST. The class ACE is defined for the evaluation of a PP-Configuration composed of at least one PP and one other component (PPs and/or PP-Modules). The evaluation of PPs is addressed in Class APE. The class ACE defines the requirements for: — Evaluating the PP-Modules in the framework of their PP-Modules Base(s) (components ACE_INT.1, ACE_CCL.1, ACE_SPD.1, ACE_OBJ.1 or ACE_OBJ.2, ACE_REQ.1 or ACE_REQ.2, and ACE_MCO.1). — Evaluating the consistency of the combination of all the PPs and PP-Modules that belong to the PP-Configuration (see ACE_CCO.1).
