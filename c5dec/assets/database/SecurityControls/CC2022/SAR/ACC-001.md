# APE Protection Profile (PP) evaluation

Evaluating a PP is required to demonstrate that the PP is sound and internally consistent, and, if the PP is based on one or more other PPs or on packages, that the PP is a correct instantiation of these PPs and packages. These properties are necessary for the PP to be suitable for use as the basis for writing an ST or another PP. Clause 7 should be used in conjunction with CC Part 1, Annexes B and D, as these annexes clarify the concepts here and provide many examples.
