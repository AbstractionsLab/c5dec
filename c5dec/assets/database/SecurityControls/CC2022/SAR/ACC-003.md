# ASE Security Target (ST) evaluation

Evaluating an ST is required to demonstrate that the ST is sound and internally consistent, and, if the ST is based on a PP-Configuration, or one or more PPs or packages, that the ST is a correct instantiation of the PP-Configuration, PPs, and packages. These properties are necessary for the ST to be suitable for use as the basis for a TOE evaluation. Clause 9 should be used in conjunction with CC Part 1, Annexes B, C and D as these annexes clarify the concepts here and provide many examples.
