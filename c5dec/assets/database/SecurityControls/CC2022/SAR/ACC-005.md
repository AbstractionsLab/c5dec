# AGD Guidance documents

The guidance documents class provides the requirements for guidance documentation for all user roles. For the secure preparation and operation of the TOE it is necessary to describe all relevant aspects for the secure handling of the TOE. The class also addresses the possibility of unintended incorrect configuration or handling of the TOE. In many cases it can be appropriate to provide guidance in separate documents for preparation and operation of the TOE, or even separate for different user roles as, e.g. end-users, administrators, application programmers using software or hardware interfaces. The guidance documents class is subdivided into two families which are concerned with the preparative user guidance (what has to be done to transform the delivered TOE into its evaluated configuration in the operational environment as described in the ST) and with the operational user guidance (what has to be done during the operation of the TOE in its evaluated configuration).
