The SAR statement of a PP-Configuration shall include an assurance rationale that demonstrates the consistency of the applicable set of SARs with those defined in the components of the PP-Configuration under evaluation and their associated Evaluation methods and Evaluation activities. For a multi-assurance PP-Configuration, the assurance rationale shall demonstrate: — that the global set of SARs is consistent with the threats as defined in the SPDs of the PP-Configuration components, and — that the global set of SARs and the sets of SARs for each sub-TSF are consistent with each other.
