# ACE_CCO.1.20C

For a multi-assurance PP-Configuration, the SAR statement shall define the global set of SARs that applies to the entire TOE and the SARs that apply to each sub-TSF. For strict and demonstrable conformance, the global assurance set of SARs shall include the set of common SARs among the PP-Configuration components, and each set of SARs that apply to a sub-TSF shall include those identified for the PP-Configuration components associated with that sub-TSF. For exact conformance, the global assurance set of SARs shall be the set of common SARs among the PP-Configuration components, and each set of SARs that apply to a sub-TSF shall be identical to those identified for the PP-Configuration components associated with that sub-TSF.
