Name: Preparative procedures
Objectives: |
  Preparative procedures are useful for ensuring that the TOE has been received and installed in a secure manner as intended by the developer. The requirements for preparation call for a secure transition from the delivered TOE to its initial operational environment. This includes investigating whether the TOE can be configured or installed in a manner that is insecure but that the user of the TOE would reasonably believe to be secure.

appNotes: |
  It is recognized that the application of these requirements will vary depending on aspects, e.g. whether the TOE is delivered in an operational state, or whether it has to be installed at the TOE owner´s site. The first process covered by the preparative procedures is the consumer´s secure acceptance of the received TOE in accordance with the developer´s delivery procedures. If the developer has not defined delivery procedures, security of the acceptance has to be ensured otherwise. Installation of the TOE includes transforming its operational environment into a state that conforms to the security objectives for the operational environment provided in the ST. It can also be the case that no installation is necessary, for example a smart card. In this case it may be inappropriate to require and analyse installation procedures. The requirements in this assurance family are presented separately from those in the Operational user guidance (AGD_OPE) family, due to the infrequent, possibly one-time use of the preparative procedures.
