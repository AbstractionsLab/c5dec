Name: PP-Module extended components definition
Objectives: |
  Extended SFRs are requirements that are not based on components from CC Part 2 or this document, but which are based on extended components: components defined by the PP-Module author. Evaluation of the definition of extended functional components is necessary to determine that they are clear and unambiguous, and that they are necessary, i.e. they may not be clearly expressed using existing CC Part 2 or this document components.
