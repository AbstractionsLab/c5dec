CompLvl: |
  The components in this family are levelled on the basis of increasing requirements for measurability of the life-cycle model, and for compliance with that model.
Name: Development Life-cycle definition
Objectives: |
  Poorly defined or uncontrolled processes applied during the development, production and maintenance of the TOE can result in a TOE that does not meet all of its security objectives. Therefore, it is important that well defined and controlled processes be established as early as possible in the TOE´s life-cycle. Defining and implementing such processes does not guarantee that the TOE meets all of its SFRs. It is possible that the processes will be insufficient or inadequate. Adopting a life-cycle model, or models that meets the needs of the developer’s organization will improve the likelihood that the development, production and maintenance processes applied to TOE support the correct design and implementation of a TOE that meets the specified SFRs. The determination of appropriate process controls in order to support process improvement is a long-established best practice.

appNotes: |
  A life-cycle model encompasses the procedures, tools and techniques used to develop and maintain the TOE. Aspects of the process that may be covered by such a model include design methods, review procedures, project management controls, change control procedures, test methods and acceptance procedures. An effective life-cycle model will address these aspects of the development and maintenance process within an overall management structure that assigns responsibilities and monitors progress. There are different types of acceptance situations that are dealt with at different locations in the criteria: — acceptance of parts delivered by subcontractors (“integration”) should be treated in this family, — Life-cycle definition (ALC_LCD), — acceptance subsequent to internal transportations in Development security (ALC_DVS), — acceptance of parts into the CM system in CM capabilities (ALC_CMC), and — acceptance of the delivered TOE by the consumer in Delivery (ALC_DEL). The first three types may overlap. Although life-cycle definition deals with the maintenance of the TOE and hence with aspects becoming relevant after the completion of the evaluation, its evaluation adds assurance through an analysis of the life-cycle information for the TOE provided at the time of the evaluation. A life-cycle model provides for the necessary control over the development and maintenance of the TOE, if the model enables sufficient minimization of the danger that the TOE will not meet its security requirement. A measurable life-cycle model is a model using some quantitative valuation (arithmetic parameters and/or metrics) of the managed product in order to measure development properties of the product. Typical metrics are source code complexity metrics, defect density (errors per size of code) or mean time to failure. For the security evaluation all those metrics are of relevance, which are used to increase quality by decreasing the probability of faults and thereby in turn increasing assurance in the security of the TOE. One should take into account that there exist standardised life-cycle models on the one hand (like the waterfall model) and standardised metrics on the other hand (like error density), which may be combined. The CC does not require the life-cycle to follow exactly one standard defining both aspects.
