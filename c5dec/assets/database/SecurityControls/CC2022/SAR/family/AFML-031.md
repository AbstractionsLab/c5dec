Acronym: ALC_CMC
CompLvl: |
  The components in this family are levelled on the basis of the CM system capabilities, the scope of the CM documentation and the evidence provided by the developer.
Name: CM capabilities
Objectives: |
  Configuration management (CM) techniques, properly defined as part of the development life-cycle model, contribute to the assurance argument that the TOE meets the SFRs. A CM system that is managed and operated correctly will help ensure the integrity of the portions of the TOE that are controlled, by providing a method of tracking any changes to the TOE, and to help ensure that all changes to the TOE are authorized. The objective of this family is to require the TOE developer´s CM system to have certain capabilities. These capabilities are intented to reduce the likelihood that accidental or unauthorised modifications of the configuration items will occur. The CM system should support maintaining the integrity of the TOE throughout the part of the TOE’s life-cycle that is under the control of the developer. The objective of introducing automated CM tools is to increase the effectiveness of the CM system. While both automated and manual CM systems can be bypassed, ignored, or proven insufficient to prevent unauthorised modification, automated systems are less susceptible to human error or negligence. The objectives of this family include the following: a) ensuring that the TOE is identifiable and complete before it is sent to the downstream user; b) ensuring that no configuration items are missed during evaluation; c) preventing unauthorised modification, addition, or deletion of TOE configuration items.

appNotes: |
  In the case where the TOE is a subset of a product, the requirements of this family apply only to the TOE configuration items, not to the product as a whole. For developer organizations that specify more than one CM application or include different instances of a CM application within the scope of the TOEs design, development, production and maintenance, it is required to document all of them. For evaluation purposes, the set of CM applications should be regarded as parts of an overall CM system, applicable to the TOE, which is addressed in the criteria. The overall CM system should address any aspects of integration between component CM applications. Several elements of this family refer to configuration items. These elements identify CM requirements to be imposed on all items identified in the configuration list, but leave the contents of the list to the discretion of the developer. CM scope (ALC_CMS) can be used to narrow this discretion by identifying specific items that must be included in the configuration list, and hence within the scope of the overall CM system. ALC_CMC.2.3C introduces a requirement that the CM system uniquely identify all configuration items. This also requires that modifications to configuration items result in a new, unique identifier being assigned to the configuration item. ALC_CMC.3.8C introduces the requirement that the evidence shall demonstrate that the CM system operates in accordance with the CM plan. Examples of such evidence can be documentation such as screen snapshots or audit trail output from the CM system, or a detailed demonstration of the CM system by the developer. The evaluator is responsible for determining that this evidence is sufficient to show that the CM system operates in accordance with the CM plan. ALC_CMC.4.5C introduces a requirement that the CM system provide an automated means to support the production of the TOE. This requires that the CM system provide an automated means to assist in determining that the correct configuration items are used in generating the TOE. ALC_CMC.5.10C introduces a requirement that the CM system provide an automated means to ascertain the changes between the TOE and its preceding version. If no previous version of the TOE exists, the developer still needs to provide an automated means to ascertain the changes between the TOE and a future version of the TOE.
