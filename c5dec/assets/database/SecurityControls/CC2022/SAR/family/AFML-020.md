Acronym: ASE_TSS
CompLvl: |
  The components in this family are levelled on whether the TOE summary specification only needs to describe how the TOE meets the SFRs, or whether the TOE summary specification also needs to describe how the TOE protects itself against logical tampering and bypass. This additional description may be used in special circumstances where there can be a specific concern regarding the TOE security architecture.
Name: TOE summary specification
Objectives: |
  The TOE summary specification enables evaluators and potential consumers to gain a general understanding of how the TOE is implemented. Evaluation of the TOE summary specification is necessary to determine whether it is adequately described how the TOE: — meets its SFRs; — protects itself against interference, logical tampering and bypass; and whether the TOE summary specification is consistent with other narrative descriptions of the TOE.
