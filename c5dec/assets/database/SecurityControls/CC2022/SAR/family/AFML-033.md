Acronym: ALC_DEL
CompLvl: |
  This family contains only one component. An increasing level of protection for the TOE is established by requiring that the delivery procedures are commensurate with the assumed attack potential in the family Vulnerability analysis (AVA_VAN) specified in the ST.
Name: Delivery
Objectives: |
  The concern of this family is the secure transfer of the finished TOE from the development environment into the responsibility of the user. The requirements for delivery call for system control and distribution facilities and procedures that detail the controls necessary to provide assurance that the security of the TOE is maintained during distribution of the TOE to the user. For a valid distribution of the TOE, the procedures used for the distribution of the TOE address the implied or identified objectives identified in the PP/ST relating to the security of the TOE during delivery.

appNotes: |
  Transfers from subcontractors to the developer or between different development sites are not considered here, but in the family Developer environment security (ALC_DVS). The end of the delivery phase is marked by the acceptance of the transfer of the TOE into the responsibility of the downstream user. NOTE: This does not necessarily coincide with the arrival of the TOE at the downstream user´s location. The delivery procedures should consider, if applicable, issues such as: a) ensuring that the TOE received by the consumer corresponds precisely to the evaluated version of the TOE; b) avoiding or detecting any tampering with the actual version of the TOE; c) preventing submission of a counterfeit version of the TOE; d) avoiding unwanted knowledge of distribution of the TOE to the consumer: there can be cases where potential attackers should not know when and how it is delivered; e) avoiding or detecting the TOE being intercepted during delivery; and f) avoiding the TOE being delayed or stopped during distribution. The delivery procedures should include the recipient´s actions implied by these issues. The consistent description of these implied actions is examined in the Preparative procedures (AGD_PRE) family, if present.
