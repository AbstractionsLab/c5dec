Acronym: ALC_FLR
CompLvl: |
  The components in this family are levelled on the basis of the increasing extent in scope of the flaw remediation procedures and the rigour of the flaw remediation policies.
Name: Flaw remediation
Objectives: |
  Flaw remediation requires that discovered security flaws be tracked and corrected by the developer. Although future compliance with flaw remediation procedures cannot be determined at the time of the TOE evaluation, it is possible to evaluate the policies and procedures that a developer has in place to track and correct flaws, and to distribute the flaw information and corrections.

appNotes: |
  This family provides assurance that the TOE will be maintained and supported in the future, requiring the TOE developer to track and correct flaws in the TOE. Additionally, requirements are included for the distribution of flaw corrections. However, this family does not impose evaluation requirements beyond the current evaluation. The TOE user is considered to be the focal point in the user organization that is responsible for receiving and implementing fixes to security flaws. This is not necessarily an individual user, but may be an organisational representative who is responsible for the handling of security flaws. The use of the term TOE user recognizes that different organisations have different procedures for handling flaw reporting, which may be done either by an individual user, or by a central administrative body. The flaw remediation procedures should describe the methods for dealing with all types of flaws encountered. These flaws may be reported by the developer, by users of the TOE, or by other parties with familiarity with the TOE. Some flaws may not be reparable immediately. There may be some occasions where a flaw cannot be fixed and other (e.g. procedural) controls must be taken. The documentation provided should cover the procedures for providing the operational sites with fixes and providing information on flaws where fixes are delayed (and what to do in the interim) or when fixes are not possible. Changes applied to a TOE after its release render it unevaluated; although some information from the original evaluation may still apply. The phrase “release of the TOE” used in this family therefore refers to a version of a product that is a release of a certified TOE, to which changes have been applied.
