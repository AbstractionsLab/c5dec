CompLvl: |
  The components in this family are levelled on the basis of the amount of information that is required to be presented with respect to the TSF, and on the degree of formalism required of the design description.
Name: TOE design
Objectives: |
  The design description of a TOE provides both context for a description of the TSF, and a thorough description of the TSF. As assurance needs increase, the level of detail provided in the description also increases. As the size and complexity of the TSF increase, multiple levels of decomposition are appropriate. The design requirements are intended to provide information (commensurate with the given assurance level) so that a determination can be made that the SFRs are realized.

  General
  The goal of design documentation is to provide sufficient information to determine the TSF boundary, and to describe how the TSF implements the SFRs. The amount and structure of the design documentation will depend on the complexity of the TOE and the number of SFRs; in general, a very complex TOE with a large number of SFRs will require more design documentation than a very simple TOE implementing only a few SFRs. Very complex TOEs will benefit (in terms of the assurance provided) from the production of differing levels of decomposition in describing the design, while very simple TOEs do not require both high-level and low-level descriptions of its implementation. This family uses two levels of decomposition: the subsystem and the module. A module is the most specific description of functionality: it is a description of the implementation. A developer should be able to implement the part of the TOE described by the module with no further design decisions. A subsystem is a description of the design of the TOE; it helps to provide a high-level description of what a portion of the TOE is doing and how. As such, a subsystem may be further divided into lower-level subsystems, or into modules. Very complex TOEs can require several levels of subsystems in order to adequately convey a useful description of how the TOE works. Very simple TOEs, in contrast, might not require a subsystem level of description; the module can clearly describe how the TOE works. The general approach adopted for design documentation is that, as the level of assurance increases, the emphasis of description shifts from the general (subsystem level) to more (module level) detail. In cases where a module-level of abstraction is appropriate because the TOE is simple enough to be described at the module level, yet the level of assurance calls for a subsystem level of description, the module-level description alone will suffice. For complex TOEs, however, this is not the case: an enormous amount of (module-level) detail would be incomprehensible without an accompanying subsystem level of description. This approach follows the general paradigm that providing additional detail about the implementation of the TSF will result in greater assurance that the SFRs are implemented correctly and provide information that can be used to demonstrate this in testing (ATE: Tests).
  Detail about the subsystems and modules
  The requirements define collections of details about subsystems and modules to be provided: a) The subsystems and modules are identified with a simple list of what they are. b) Subsystems and modules may be categorised (either implicitly or explicitly) as “SFR-enforcing”, “SFR-supporting”, or “SFR-non-interfering”; these terms are used the same as they are used in Functional specification (ADV_FSP). c) A subsystem´s behaviour is what it does. The behaviour may also be categorised as SFR-enforcing, SFR-supporting, or SFR-non-interfering. The behaviour of the subsystem is never categorised as more SFR-relevant than the category of the subsystem itself. For example, an SFR-enforcing subsystem can have SFR-enforcing behaviour as well as SFR-supporting or SFR-non-interfering behaviour. d) A behaviour summary of a subsystem is an overview of the actions it performs (e.g. “The TCP subsystem assembles IP datagrams into reliable byte streams”). e) A behaviour description of a subsystem is an explanation of everything it does. This description should be at a level of detail that one can readily determine whether the behaviour has any relevance to the enforcement of the SFRs. f) A description of interactions among or between subsystems or modules identifies the reason that subsystems or modules communicate and characterizes the information that is passed. It need not define the information to the same level of detail as an interface specification. For example, it would be sufficient to say “subsystem X requests a block of memory from the memory manager, which responds with the location of the allocated memory. g) A description of interfaces provides the details of how the interactions among modules are achieved. Rather than describing the reason the modules are communicating or the purpose of their communication (i.e. the description of interactions), the description of interfaces describes the details of how that communication is accomplished, in terms of the structure and contents of the messages, semaphores, internal process communications. h) The purpose describes how a module provides their functionality. It provides sufficient detail that no further design decisions are needed. The correspondence between the implementation representation that implements the module, and the purpose of the module should be readily apparent. i) A module is otherwise described in terms of whatever is identified in the element. Subsystems and modules, and “SFR-enforcing” are all further explained in greater detail in A.4, ADV_TDS: Subsystems and Modules.
