CompLvl: |
  The components in this family are levelled on the basis of increasing requirements on the description and scope of the implementation standards and the documentation of implementation-dependent options.
Name: Tools and techniques
Objectives: |
  Tools and techniques is an aspect of selecting tools that are used to develop, analyse and implement the TOE. It includes requirements to prevent ill-defined, inconsistent or incorrect development tools from being used to develop the TOE. This includes, but is not limited to, programming languages, documentation, implementation standards, and other parts of the TOE such as supporting runtime libraries.

appNotes: |
  There is a requirement for well-defined development tools. These are tools that are clearly and completely described. For example, programming languages and computer aided design (CAD) systems that are based on a standard published by standards bodies are considered to be well-defined. Self-made tools would need further investigation to clarify whether they are well-defined. The requirement in ALC_TAT.1.2C is especially applicable to programming languages so as to ensure that all statements in the source code have an unambiguous meaning. In ALC_TAT.2 and ALC_TAT.3, implementation guidelines may be accepted as an implementation standard if they have been approved by some group of experts (e.g. academic experts, standards bodies). Implementation standards are normally public, well accepted and common practise in a specific industry, but developer-specific implementation guidelines may also be accepted as a standard; the emphasis is on the expertise. Tools and techniques distinguishes between the implementation standards applied by the developer (ALC_TAT.2.3D) and the implementation standards for “all parts of the TOE” (ALC_TAT.3.3D) which include third party software, hardware, or firmware. The configuration list introduced in CM scope (ALC_CMS) requires that for each TSF relevant configuration item to indicate if it has been generated by the TOE developer or by third party developers
