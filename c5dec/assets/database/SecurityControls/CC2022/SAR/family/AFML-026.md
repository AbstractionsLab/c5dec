CompLvl: This family contains only one component.
Name: Security policy modelling
Objectives: |
  It is the objective of this family to provide additional assurance through the development of a formal representation of the TSF and its properties, as defined by the SFRs and the security objectives of the ST, further referred to as the formal model and the formal properties, respectively. It is expected to establish by means of a formal proof that these formal properties hold in the formal model and to establish by means of a correspondence rationale that the TOE functional specification preserves the formal properties proven for the formal model. A formal proof or semiformal demonstration of preservation of the formal properties in the formal or semiformal specification is expected if the latter exists (ADV_FSP.5 or ADV_FSP.6, respectively).

appNotes: |
  Inadequacies in a TOE can result either from a failure in understanding the security requirements or from a flawed implementation of those security requirements. Defining the security requirements adequately to ensure their understanding may be problematic because the definition must be sufficiently precise to prevent undesired results or subtle flaws during the implementation of the TOE. Throughout the design, implementation, and review processes, a formal representation of the TSF and its properties may be used as precise design and implementation guidance, thereby providing increased assurance that the SFRs and the security objectives of the ST are satisfied by the TOE. The resulting guidance and the precision of the TSF representation and its properties, as defined by the SFRs and the security objectives of the ST, are significantly improved by defining the formal model and specifying the formal properties using a formal language and providing a formal proof that these formal properties hold in the formal model. The creation of a formal Security Policy Model (SPM) of the TSF must be complete with respect to the ST; such a model helps to identify and eliminate ambiguous, inconsistent, contradictory, or unenforceable elements and to avoid any misunderstanding on the scope. To this end, the evaluation must determine whether the formal model and the formal properties completely cover the ST and accept only STs and SPMs that match in scope. Once the TOE has been built, the formal model serves the evaluation effort by contributing to the evaluatorÂ´s judgement of how well the developer has understood the TSF being implemented and whether there are inconsistencies between the formal properties as defined by the security objectives of the ST and the TOE design. The confidence gained by formally proving properties of the model is accompanied by confidence gained by defining a correspondence rationale between the formal model and the TOE functional specification (as defined for ADV_FSP). The correspondence rationale consists of a formal proof when mapping to formal aspects of the TOE functional specification and semiformal demonstration otherwise. A combination of different formal systems (modelling languages, tools, proof systems) can be used for different parts of the ST (SFRs & Security Objectives) and correspondence rationales.
