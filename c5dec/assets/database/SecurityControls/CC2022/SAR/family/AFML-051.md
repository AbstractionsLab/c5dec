Acronym: ACO_VUL
CompLvl: |
  The components in this family are levelled on the basis of increasing scrutiny of vulnerability information from the public domain and independent vulnerability analysis.
Name: Composition vulnerability analysis
Objectives: |
  This family calls for an analysis of vulnerability information available in the public domain and of vulnerabilities that may be introduced as a result of the composition.
active: true
appNotes: |
  The developer will provide details of any residual vulnerabilities reported during evaluation of the components. These may be gained from the component developers or evaluation reports for the components. These will be used as inputs into the evaluatorÂ´s vulnerability analysis of the composed TOE in the operational environment. The operational environment of the composed TOE is examined to ensure that the assumptions and objectives for the component operational environment (specified in each component ST) are satisfied in the composed TOE. An initial analysis of the consistency of assumptions and objectives between the components and the composed TOE STs will have been performed during the conduct of the ASE activities for the composed TOE. However, this analysis is revisited with the knowledge acquired during the ACO_REL, ACO_DEV and the ACO_COR activities to ensure that, for example, assumptions of the dependent component that were addressed by the environment in the dependent component ST are not reintroduced as a result of composition (i.e. that the base component adequately addresses the assumptions of the dependent component ST in the composed TOE). A search by the evaluator for issues in each component will identify potential vulnerabilities reported in the public domain since completion of the evaluation of the components. Any potential vulnerabilities will then be subject to testing. If the base component used in the composed TOE has been the subject of assurance continuity activities since certification, the evaluator will consider during the composed TOE vulnerability analysis activities the changes made in base component.
