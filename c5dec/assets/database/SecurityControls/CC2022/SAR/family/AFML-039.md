Acronym: ALC_COMP
CompLvl: This family contains only one component.
Name: |
  Integration of composition parts and consistency check of delivery procedures
Objectives: |
  The aim of this family is to determine whether — the correct version of the dependent component is installed onto / embedded into the correct version of the related base component, and — the preparative guidance procedures of the base component developer and the dependent component developer are compatible with the acceptance procedures of the composite product integrator.
active: true
appNotes: |
  The composite product evaluator shall verify that the correct version of the dependent component under evaluation has been installed onto / embedded into the evaluated version of the related base component of the composite product. The composite product evaluation sponsor shall ensure that appropriate evidence generated by the composite product integrator is available for the composite product evaluator. This evidence may include, amongst other, the configuration list of the base component developer (e.g. provided within his acknowledgement statement). The composite product evaluator shall verify that the delivery procedures of the base component developer and the dependent component developer are compatible with the acceptance procedures used by the composite product integrator. The composite product evaluator shall verify that all configuration parameters prescribed by the base component developer and the dependent component developer (e.g. pre-personalization data, pre-personalisation scripts) are used by the composite product integrator. The composite product evaluation sponsor shall ensure that appropriate evidence generated by the composite product integrator is available for the composite product evaluator. This evidence may include, amongst other, the element of evidence for the dependent component reception, acceptance and parameterisation by the base component developer (e.g. in form of his acknowledgement statement).
