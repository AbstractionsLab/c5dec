appNotes: |
  This family deals with controls to remove or reduce threads and security risks existing at the developer´s site. The evaluator should visit the site(s) in order to assess evidence for development security. This may include sites of subcontractors involved in the TOE development and production. Any decision not to visit shall be agreed with the evaluation authority. Although development security deals with the maintenance of the TOE and hence with aspects becoming relevant after the completion of the evaluation, the Developer environment security (ALC_DVS) requirements specify only that the development security controls be in place at the time of evaluation. Furthermore, Developer environment security (ALC_DVS) does not contain any requirements related to the sponsor´s intention to apply the development security controls in the future, after completion of the evaluation. It is recognized that confidentiality may not always be an issue for the protection of the TOE in its development environment. The use of the word “necessary” allows for the selection of appropriate safeguards.
