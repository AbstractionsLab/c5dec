Name: Vulnerability assessment
active: true
applicationNotes: |
  Generally, the vulnerability assessment activity covers various vulnerabilities in the development and operation of the TOE. Development vulnerabilities take advantage of some property of the TOE, or the product where the TOE resides, which was introduced during its development, e.g. defeating the TSF self-protection through tampering, direct attack or monitoring of the TSF, defeating the TSF domain separation through monitoring or direct attack the TSF, or defeating non-bypassability through circumventing (bypassing) the TSF. Explicit dependencies of the TOE on IT systems in the environment must also be considered. Operational vulnerabilities take advantage of weaknesses in non-technical countermeasures to violate the TOE SFRs, e.g. misuse or incorrect configuration. Misuse investigates whether the TOE can be configured or used in a manner that is insecure, but that an administrator or user of the TOE would reasonably believe to be secure. Assessment of development vulnerabilities is covered by the assurance family AVA_VAN. Basically, all development vulnerabilities can be considered in the context of AVA_VAN due to the fact, that this family allows application of a wide range of assessment methodologies being unspecific to the kind of an attack scenario. These unspecific assessment methodologies comprise, among other, also the specific methodologies for those TSF where covert channels are to be considered (a channel capacity estimation can be done using informal engineering measurements, as well as actual test measurements) or can be overcome by the use of sufficient resources in the form of a direct attack (underlying technical concept of those TSF is based on probabilistic or permutational mechanisms; a qualification of their security behaviour and the effort required to overcome them can be made using a quantitative or statistical analysis). If there are security objectives specified in the ST to either to prevent one user of the TOE from observing activity associated with another user of the TOE, or to ensure that information flows cannot be used to achieve enforced illicit data signals, covert channel analysis should be considered during the conduct of the vulnerability analysis. This is often reflected by the inclusion of Unobservability (FPR_UNO) and multilevel access control policies specified through Access control policy (FDP_ACC) and/or Information flow control policy (FDP_IFC) requirements in the ST.

# AVA Vulnerability assessment

The AVA: Vulnerability assessment class addresses the possibility of exploitable vulnerabilities introduced in the development or the operation of the TOE.
