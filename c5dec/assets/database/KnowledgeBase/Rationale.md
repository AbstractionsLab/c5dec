CC Part 1 section A.7.3 states that "a security objectives rationale [contains] two
sections:
- a tracing that shows which security objectives address which threats, OSPs
and assumptions;
- a set of justifications that shows that all threats, OSPs, and assumptions are
effectively addressed by the security objectives.‚Äù
210 The first one is best addressed by a table, having the threats, OSPs and assumptions
on the rows, and the security objectives on the column, and "X" marking a place in
the table if that security objective traces to that threat, OSP or assumption. Its
purpose is to show that:
- Each security objective traces to at least one threat, OSP or assumption. In
other words, each column has to have at least one "X" in it.
- Each threat, OSP and assumption has at least one security objective tracing to
it. In other word, each row has to have at least one "X" in it.
- Assumptions can only be traced to by security objectives for the operational
environment.

The second one is slightly harder. For each threat and OSP, you have to describe
HOW the security objectives counter/meet it. If you have done the analysis
prescribed by the explanation method, this can be derived from that analysis, as all
the elements that are needed are there. They just need to be collected and described
in a short, to-the-point, and understandable way.
