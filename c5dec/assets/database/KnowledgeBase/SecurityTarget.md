# Security Target

**Acronym:** ST

A ST is a document that describes a specific [TOE](./TargetofEvaluation.md), the [conformance claims](./ConformanceClaims.md) applicable to the evaluation of the TOE, the [security problem](./SecurityProblemDefinition.md) to be addressed, the [security objectives](./SecurityObjective.md) for the TOE and its operational environment, the [security requirements](./SecurityRequirement.md) applicable to solving the stated security problem, and additional material necessary to describe the TOE sufficiently for evaluation. STs are generally based upon [PPs](ProtectionProfile.md) or [PP-Configurations](PP-Configuration.md) that describe a security problem and security requirements for a TOE type that is relevant to the specific TOE, but can also be defined as standalone documents.
A ST is typically produced by a [developer](./DefDeveloper.md) and the audience for the ST includes [evaluators](./DefEvaluator.md), [certifying body](./DefCertificationBody.md) and [end users](./DefEndUser.md) of the evaluated TOE.

STs can be evaluated according to
- [Single-assurance Evaluation](./Single-assuranceEvaluation.md): evaluation of a TOE using one set of [assurance requirements](./SecurityAssuranceRequirement.md)
- [Multi-assurance Evaluation](./Multi-assuranceEvaluation.md): evaluation of a TOE using a PP-Configuration where each PP-Configuration component is associated with its own set of assurance requirements.

A ST can either adopt the [direct rationale](./DirectRationale.md) model or the standard model.
