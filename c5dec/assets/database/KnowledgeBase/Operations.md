# Operations

**Acronym:** None

CC allows the modification of [SFRs](SecurityFunctionalRequirement.md) and [SARs](SecurityAssuranceRequirement.md) by applying operations. The permitted operations are selected from the following set:
- [Iteration](Operation-Iteration.md): allows a component to be used more than once with varying operations;
- [Assignment](Operation-Assignment.md): allows the specification of parameters;
- [Selection](Operation-Selection.md): allows the specification of one or more items from a list; and
- [Refinement](Operation-Refinement.md): allows the addition of details.
The assignment and selection operations are permitted only where specifically indicated in a security requirement. Iteration and refinement are permitted for all security requirements.
