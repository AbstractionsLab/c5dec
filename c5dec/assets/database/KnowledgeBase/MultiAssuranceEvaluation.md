# Multi Assurance Evaluation

**Acronym:**

In contrast to the [single assurance evaluation](./SingleAssuranceEvaluation.md), the multi assurance evaluation considers a global set of [SARs](./SecurityAssuranceRequirement.md) to apply to the entire [TOE](./TargetofEvaluation.md), while sets of SARs apply to individual [sub-TSFs](./SubTOESecurityFunctionality.md). In order to ensure that the set of SARs associated with a sub-TSF does not impact other sub-TSFs, multi assurance evaluations require an assurance rationale to demonstrate the consistency of the sets of SARs.
