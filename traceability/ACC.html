<p>Evaluating a PP-Configuration is required to demonstrate that the PP-Configuration is sound and consistent. These properties are necessary for the PP-Configuration to be suitable for use as the basis for writing an ST. The class ACE is defined for the evaluation of a PP-Configuration composed of at least one PP and one other component (PPs and/or PP-Modules). The evaluation of PPs is addressed in Class APE. The class ACE defines the requirements for: — Evaluating the PP-Modules in the framework of their PP-Modules Base(s) (components ACE_INT.1, ACE_CCL.1, ACE_SPD.1, ACE_OBJ.1 or ACE_OBJ.2, ACE_REQ.1 or ACE_REQ.2, and ACE_MCO.1). — Evaluating the consistency of the combination of all the PPs and PP-Modules that belong to the PP-Configuration (see ACE_CCO.1).</p>

<h2 id="ACC-004">1.3 ADV Development <small>ACC-004</small></h2>
<p>The requirements of the Development class provide information about the TOE. The knowledge obtained by this information is used as the basis for conducting vulnerability analysis and testing upon the TOE, as described in the AVA and ATE classes. The Development class encompasses seven families of requirements for structuring and representing the TSF at various levels and varying forms of abstraction. These families include: — requirements for the description (at the various levels of abstraction) of the design and implementation of the SFRs (ADV_FSP, ADV_TDS, ADV_IMP and ADV_COMP). — requirements for the description of the architecture-oriented features of domain separation, TSF self-protection and non-bypassability of the security functionality (ADV_ARC). — requirements for a security policy model and for correspondence mappings between security policy model and the functional specification (ADV_SPM). — requirements on the internal structure of the TSF, which covers aspects such as modularity, layering, and minimization of complexity (ADV_INT). When documenting the security functionality of a TOE, there are two properties that need to be demonstrated. The first property is that the security functionality works correctly, i.e. it performs as specified. The second property, and one that is arguably harder to demonstrate, is that the TOE cannot be used in a way such that the security functionality can be corrupted or bypassed. These two properties require somewhat different approaches in analysis, and so the families in ADV are structured to support these different approaches. The families Functional specification (ADV_FSP), TOE design (ADV_TDS), Implementation representation (ADV_IMP), and Security policy modelling (ADV_SPM) deal with the first property: the specification of the security functionality. The families Security Architecture (ADV_ARC) and TSF internals (ADV_INT) deal with the second property: the specification of the design of the TOE demonstrating the security functionality cannot be corrupted or bypassed. It should be noted that both properties need to be realized: the more confidence one has that the properties are satisfied, the more trustworthy the TOE is. The TSF of a composite product are represented at various levels of abstraction in the families of the development class ADV. The family Composite design compliance (ADV_COMP) determines whether the requirements on the dependent component, imposed by the related base componen, are fulfilled in a composite product. Due to the distribution of the TSF of a composite product to various levels in the families of the class ADV, this family is not represented in Figure 7. The components in the families are designed so that more assurance can be gained as the components hierarchically increase. The paradigm for the families targeted at the first property is one of design decomposition. At the highest level, there is a functional specification of the TSF in terms of its interfaces (describing what the TSF does in terms of requests to the TSF for services and resulting responses), decomposing the TSF into smaller units (dependent on the assurance desired and the complexity of the TOE) and describing how the TSF accomplishes its functions (to a level of detail commensurate with the assurance level), and showing the implementation of the TSF. A formal model of the security behaviour also may be given. All levels of decomposition are used in determining the completeness and accuracy of all other levels, ensuring that the levels are mutually supportive. The requirements for the various TSF representations are separated into different families, to allow the PP/ST author to specify which TSF representations are required. The level chosen will dictate the assurance desired/gained. Figure 7 indicates the relationships among the various TSF representations of the ADV class, as well as their relationships with other classes. As the figure indicates, the APE and ASE classes define the requirements for the correspondence between the SFRs and the security objectives for the TOE. Class ASE also defines requirements for the correspondence between both the security objectives and SFRs, and for the TOE summary specification which explains how the TOE meets its SFRs. The activities of ALC_CMC.5.2E include the verification that the TSF that is tested under the ATE and AVA classes is in fact the one described by all of the ADV decomposition levels. The requirements for all other correspondence shown in Figure 7 are defined in the ADV class for the TOE. The Security policy modelling (ADV_SPM) family defines the requirements for formally modelling selected SFRs and providing correspondence between the functional specification and the formal model. Each assurance family specific to a TSF representation (i.e. Functional specification (ADV_FSP), TOE design (ADV_TDS) and Implementation representation (ADV_IMP)) defines requirements relating that TSF representation to the SFRs. All decompositions must accurately reflect all other decompositions (i.e. be mutually supportive); the developer supplies the tracings in the last .C elements of the components. Assurance relating to this factor is obtained during the analysis for each of the levels of decomposition by referring to other levels of decomposition (in a recursive fashion) while the analysis of a particular level of decomposition is being performed; the evaluator verifies the correspondence as part of the second E element. The understanding gained from these levels of decomposition form the basis of the functional and penetration testing efforts. The ADV_INT family is not represented in this figure, as it is related to the internal structure of the TSF, and is only indirectly related to the process of refinement of the TSF representations. Similarly, the ADV_ARC family is not represented in the figure because it relates to the architectural soundness, rather than representation, of the TSF. Both ADV_INT and ADV_ARC relate to the analysis of the property that the TOE cannot be made to circumvent or corrupt its security functionality. The TOE security functionality (TSF) consists of all parts of the TOE that shall be relied upon for enforcement of the SFRs. The TSF includes both functionality that directly enforces the SFRs, as well as functionality that, while not directly enforcing the SFRs, contributes to their enforcement in a more indirect manner, including functionality with the capability to cause the SFRs to be violated. This includes portions of the TOE that are invoked on start-up that are responsible for putting the TSF into its initial secure state. Several important concepts were used in the development of the components of the ADV families. These concepts, while introduced briefly here, are explained more fully in the application notes for the families. One over-riding notion is that, as more information becomes available, greater assurance can be obtained that the security functionality a) is correctly implemented; b) cannot be corrupted; and c) cannot be bypassed. This is done through the verification that the documentation is correct and consistent with other documentation, and by providing information that can be used to ensure that the testing activities (both functional and penetration testing) are comprehensive. This is reflected in the levelling of the components of the families. In general, components are levelled based on the amount of information that is to be provided (and subsequently analysed). While not true for all TOEs, it is generally the case that the TSF is sufficiently complex that there are portions of the TSF that deserve more intense examination than other portions of the TSF. Determining those portions is unfortunately somewhat subjective, thus terminology and components have been defined such that as the level of assurance increases, the responsibility for determining what portions of the TSF need to be examined in detail shifts from the developer to the evaluator. To aid in expressing this concept, the following terminology is introduced. It should be noted that in the families of the class, this terminology is used when expressing SFR-related portions of the TOE (i.e. elements and work units embodied in the Functional specification (ADV_FSP), TOE design (ADV_TDS), and Implementation representation (ADV_IMP) families). While the general concept (that some portions of the TOE are more interesting than others) applies to other families, the criteria are expressed differently in order to obtain the assurance required. All portions of the TSF are security relevant, meaning that they must preserve the security of the TOE as expressed by the SFRs and requirements for domain separation and non-bypassability. One aspect of security relevance is the degree to which a portion of the TSF enforces a security requirement. Since different portions of the TOE play different roles (or no apparent role at all) in enforcing security requirements, this creates a continuum of SFR relevance: at one end of this continuum are portions of the TOE that are termed SFR-enforcing. Such portions play a direct role in implementing any SFR on the TOE. Such SFRs refer to any functionality provided by one of the SFRs contained in the ST. It should be noted that the definition of plays a role in for SFR-enforcing functionality is impossible to express quantitatively. For example, in the implementation of a Discretionary Access Control (DAC) mechanism, a very narrow view of SFR-enforcing can be the several lines of code that actually perform the check of a subject´s attributes against the object´s attributes. A broader view would include the software entity (e.g. C function) that contained the several lines of code. A broader view still would include callers of the C function, since they would be responsible for enforcing the decision returned by the attribute check. A still broader view would include any code in the call tree (or programming equivalent for the implementation language used) for that C function (e.g. a sort function that sorted access control list entries in a first-match algorithm implementation). At some point, the component is not so much enforcing the security policy but rather plays a supporting role; such components are termed SFR supporting. One of the characteristics of SFR-supporting functionality is that it is trusted to preserve the correctness of the SFR implementation by operating without error. Such functionality may be depended on by SFR-enforcing functionality, but the dependence is generally at a functional level; for example, memory management, buffer management, etc. Further down on the security relevance continuum is functionality termed SFR non-interfering. Such functionality has no role in implementing the SFRs and is likely part of the TSF because of its environment; for example, any code running in a privileged hardware mode on an operating system. It needs to be considered part of the TSF because, if compromised (or replaced by malicious code), it can compromise the correct operation of an SFR by virtue of its operating in the privileged hardware mode. An example of SFR non-interfering functionality can be a set of mathematical floating point operations implemented in kernel mode for speed considerations. The architecture family [Security Architecture (ADV_ARC)] provides for requirements and analysis of the TOE based on properties of domain separation, self-protection, and non-bypassability. These properties relate to the SFRs in that, if these properties are not present, it will likely lead to the failure of mechanisms implementing SFRs. Functionality and design relating to these properties is not considered a part of the continuum described above, but instead is treated separately due to its fundamentally different nature and analysis requirements. The difference in analysis of the implementation of SFRs (SFR-enforcing and SFR-supporting functionality) and the implementation of somewhat fundamental security properties of the TOE, which include the initialisation, self-protection, and non-bypassability concerns, is that the SFR-related functionality is more or less directly visible and relatively easy to test, while the above-mentioned properties require varying degrees of analysis on a much broader set of functionality. Further, the depth of analysis for such properties will vary depending on the design of the TOE. The ADV families are constructed to address this by a separate family [Security Architecture (ADV_ARC)] devoted to analysis of the initialisation, self-protection, and non-bypassability requirements, while the other families are concerned with analysis of the functionality supporting SFRs. Even in cases where different descriptions are necessary for the multiple levels of abstraction, it is not absolutely necessary for each and every TSF representation to be in a separate document. Indeed, it may be the case that a single document meets the documentation requirements for more than one TSF representation, since it is the information about each of these TSF representations that is required, rather than the resulting document structure. In cases where multiple TSF representations are combined within a single document, the developer should indicate which portions of the documents meet which requirements. Three types of specification style are mandated by this class: informal, semiformal and formal. The functional specification and TOE design documentation are always written in either informal or semiformal style. A semiformal style reduces the ambiguity in these documents over an informal presentation. A formal specification may also be required in addition to the semi-formal presentation; the value is that a description of the TSF in more than one way will add increased assurance that the TSF has been completely and accurately specified. An informal specification is written as prose in natural language. Natural language is used here as meaning communication in any commonly spoken tongue (e.g. Spanish, German, French, English, Dutch). An informal specification is not subject to any notational or special restrictions other than those required as ordinary conventions for that language (e.g. grammar and syntax). While no notational restrictions apply, the informal specification is also required to provide defined meanings for terms that are used in a context other than that accepted by normal usage. The difference between semiformal and informal documents is only a matter of formatting or presentation: a semiformal notation includes, e.g. an explicit glossary of terms, a standardised presentation format. A semiformal specification is written to a standard presentation template. The presentation should use terms consistently if written in a natural language. The presentation may also use more structured languages/diagrams (e.g. data-flow diagrams, state transition diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, data structure diagrams, and process or program structure diagrams). Whether based on diagrams or natural language, a set of conventions must be used in the presentation. The glossary explicitly identifies the words that are being used in a precise and constant manner; similarly, the standardised format implies that extreme care has been taken in methodically preparing the document in a manner that maximises clarity. It should be noted that fundamentally different portions of the TSF may have different semiformal notation conventions and presentation styles (as long as the number of different “semiformal notations” is small); this still conforms to the concept of a semiformal presentation. A formal specification is written in a notation based upon well-established mathematical concepts and is typically accompanied by supporting explanatory (informal) prose. These mathematical concepts are used to define the syntax and semantics of the notation and the proof rules that support logical reasoning. The syntactic and semantic rules supporting a formal notation should define how to recognize constructs unambiguously and determine their meaning. There needs to be evidence that it is impossible to derive contradictions, and all rules supporting the notation need to be defined or referenced. In case of a multi-assurance evaluation the requirements for the description (at the various levels of abstraction) of the design and implementation of the SFRs (ADV_FSP, ADV_TDS, ADV_IMP and ADV_COMP) will be presented for the sub-TSF of the TOE. The architecture family (Security Architecture (ADV_ARC)) provides for requirements and analysis of the TOE based on properties of domain separation, self-protection, and non-bypassability which also may hold for boundaries between the sub-TSF.</p>

<h2 id="ACC-005">1.4 AGD Guidance documents <small>ACC-005</small></h2>
<p>The guidance documents class provides the requirements for guidance documentation for all user roles. For the secure preparation and operation of the TOE it is necessary to describe all relevant aspects for the secure handling of the TOE. The class also addresses the possibility of unintended incorrect configuration or handling of the TOE. In many cases it can be appropriate to provide guidance in separate documents for preparation and operation of the TOE, or even separate for different user roles as, e.g. end-users, administrators, application programmers using software or hardware interfaces. The guidance documents class is subdivided into two families which are concerned with the preparative user guidance (what has to be done to transform the delivered TOE into its evaluated configuration in the operational environment as described in the ST) and with the operational user guidance (what has to be done during the operation of the TOE in its evaluated configuration).</p>

<h2 id="ACC-006">1.5 ALC Life-cycle support <small>ACC-006</small></h2>
<p>Life-cycle support is an aspect of establishing appropriate security controls in the development, production, delivery and maintenance of the TOE. Confidence in the correspondence between the TOE security requirements and the TOE is greater if security analysis and the production of the evidence are done on a regular basis as an integral part of the development, production, delivery and maintenance activities. During the life-cycle of the TOE it is distinguished whether the TOE is under the responsibility of the TOE developer or the user rather than whether it is located in the development or the user environment. The point of transition is when the TOE is accepted by the user. User in this context relates to the end-user as well as product- and system integrators. The ALC class consists of nine families: — Development Life-cycle definition (ALC_LCD) provides requirements for the developer’s description of the life-cycle model used in the development, production, delivery and maintenance life-cycle of the TOE; — CM capabilities (ALC_CMC) provides requirements for the management of the configuration items; — CM scope (ALC_CMS) requires a minimum set of configuration items to be managed in the defined way; — Developer environment security (ALC_DVS) is concerned with the developer´s physical, logical, procedural, personnel, and other security controls; — Tools and techniques (ALC_TAT) provides requirements for the development tools and implementation standards used by the developer; — Flaw remediation (ALC_FLR) provides requirements for the handling of security flaws; — Delivery (ALC_DEL) provides requirements for the procedures used for the delivery of the TOE to the downstream user. Delivery processes occurring during the development of the TOE are denoted rather as transfers, and are handled in the context of integration and acceptance procedures in other families of this class; — ALC_TDA is concerned with the generation of certain artefacts during the development process; — ALC_COMP is concerned with the integration of composition parts and a consistency check of delivery procedures. Throughout this class, development and related terms (developer, develop) are meant in the more general sense to comprise development and production, whereas production specifically means the process of transforming the implementation representation into the final TOE.</p>

<h2 id="ACC-007">1.6 ATE Tests <small>ACC-007</small></h2>
<p>The class “Tests” encompasses five families: Coverage (ATE_COV), Depth (ATE_DPT), Independent testing (ATE_IND) (i.e. functional testing performed by evaluators), Functional tests (ATE_FUN) and Composite functional testing (ATE_COMP). Testing provides assurance that the TSF behaves as described (in the functional specification, TOE design, implementation representation, and allows straightforward traceability of SFR in test scenario). The emphasis in this class is on confirmation that the TSF operates according to its design descriptions. This class does not address penetration testing, which is based upon an analysis of the TSF that specifically seeks to identify vulnerabilities in the design and implementation of the TSF. Penetration testing is addressed separately as an aspect of vulnerability assessment in the AVA: Vulnerability assessment class. The ATE: Tests class separates testing into developer testing and evaluator testing. The Coverage (ATE_COV), and Depth (ATE_DPT) families address the completeness of developer testing. Coverage (ATE_COV) addresses the rigour with which the functional specification is tested; Depth (ATE_DPT) addresses whether testing against other design descriptions (security architecture, TOE design, and implementation representation) is required. Functional tests (ATE_FUN) addresses the performing of the tests by the developer and how this testing should be documented. Finally, Independent testing (ATE_IND) then addresses evaluator testing: whether the evaluator should repeat part or all of the developer testing and how much independent testing the evaluator should do. Composite functional testing (ATE_COMP) determines whether the composite product as a whole exhibits the properties necessary to satisfy the functional requirements of its ST.</p>

<td>Generally, the vulnerability assessment activity covers various vulnerabilities in the development and operation of the TOE. Development vulnerabilities take advantage of some property of the TOE, or the product where the TOE resides, which was introduced during its development, e.g. defeating the TSF self-protection through tampering, direct attack or monitoring of the TSF, defeating the TSF domain separation through monitoring or direct attack the TSF, or defeating non-bypassability through circumventing (bypassing) the TSF. Explicit dependencies of the TOE on IT systems in the environment must also be considered. Operational vulnerabilities take advantage of weaknesses in non-technical countermeasures to violate the TOE SFRs, e.g. misuse or incorrect configuration. Misuse investigates whether the TOE can be configured or used in a manner that is insecure, but that an administrator or user of the TOE would reasonably believe to be secure. Assessment of development vulnerabilities is covered by the assurance family AVA_VAN. Basically, all development vulnerabilities can be considered in the context of AVA_VAN due to the fact, that this family allows application of a wide range of assessment methodologies being unspecific to the kind of an attack scenario. These unspecific assessment methodologies comprise, among other, also the specific methodologies for those TSF where covert channels are to be considered (a channel capacity estimation can be done using informal engineering measurements, as well as actual test measurements) or can be overcome by the use of sufficient resources in the form of a direct attack (underlying technical concept of those TSF is based on probabilistic or permutational mechanisms; a qualification of their security behaviour and the effort required to overcome them can be made using a quantitative or statistical analysis). If there are security objectives specified in the ST to either to prevent one user of the TOE from observing activity associated with another user of the TOE, or to ensure that information flows cannot be used to achieve enforced illicit data signals, covert channel analysis should be considered during the conduct of the vulnerability analysis. This is often reflected by the inclusion of Unobservability (FPR_UNO) and multilevel access control policies specified through Access control policy (FDP_ACC) and/or Information flow control policy (FDP_IFC) requirements in the ST.</td>

<h2 id="ACC-009">1.8 ACO Composition <small>ACC-009</small></h2>
<p>The class ACO: Composition encompasses five families. These families specify assurance requirements that are designed to provide confidence that a composed TOE will operate securely when relying upon security functionality provided by previously evaluated software, firmware or hardware components. Composition involves taking two or more IT entities successfully evaluated against the CC security assurance requirements packages (base components and dependent components, see Annex B) and combining them for use, with no further development of either IT entity. The development of additional IT entities is not included (entities that have not previously been the subject of a component evaluation). The composed TOE forms a new product that can be installed and integrated into any specific environment instance that meets the objectives for the environment. This approach does not provide an alternative approach for the evaluation of components. Composition under ACO provides a composed TOE integrator a method, which can be used as an alternative to other assurance levels specified in the CC, to gain confidence in a TOE that is the combination of two or more successfully evaluated components without having to re-evaluate the composite TSF. The composed TOE integrator is referred to as “developer” throughout the ACO class, with any references to the developer of the base or dependent components clarified as such. CAPs, as defined in CC Part 5 provide an assurance scale for composed TOEs. This assurance scale is required in addition to other assurance packages, for example the EALs, because to combine components evaluated against another assurance package and gain equivalent assurance in the resulting composed TOE, all SARs shall be applied to the composed TOE. Although reuse can be made of the component TOE evaluation results, there are often additional aspects of the components that have to be considered in the composed TOE, as described in B.3. Due to the different parties involved in a composed TOE evaluation activity it is generally not possible to gain all necessary evidence about these additional aspects of the components to apply the appropriate EAL. Hence, CAPs have been defined to address the issue of combining evaluated components and gaining a meaningful result. This is discussed further in Annex B. In a composed TOE it is generally the case that one component relies on the services provided by another component. The component requiring services is termed the dependent component and the component providing the services is termed the base component. This interaction and distinct is discussed further in Annex B. It is assumed to be the case that the developer of the dependent component is supporting the composed TOE evaluation in some manner (as developer, sponsor, or just cooperating and providing the necessary evaluation evidence from the dependent component evaluation) The ACO components included in the CAP assurance packages should not be used as augmentations for component TOE evaluations, as this would provide no meaningful assurance for the component. The families within the ACO class interact in a similar manner to the ADV, ATE and AVA classes in a component TOE evaluation and hence leverage from the specification of requirements from those classes where applicable. There are however a few items specific to composed TOE evaluations. To determine how the components interact and identify any deviations from the evaluations of the components, the dependencies that the dependent component has upon the underlying base component are identified (ACO_REL). This reliance on the base component is specified in terms of the interfaces through which the dependent component makes calls for services in support of the dependent component SFRs. The interfaces, and at higher levels the supporting behaviour, provided by the base component in response to those service requests are analysed in ACO_DEV. The ACO_DEV family is based on the ADV_TDS family, as at the simplest level the TSF of each component can be viewed as a subsystem of the composed TOE, with additional portions of each component seen as additional subsystems. Therefore, the interfaces between the components are seen as interactions between subsystems in a component TOE evaluation. It is possible that the interfaces and supporting behaviour descriptions provided for ACO_DEV are incomplete. This is determined during the conduct of ACO_COR. The ACO_COR family takes the outputs of ACO_REL and ACO_DEV and determines whether the components are being used in their evaluated configuration and identifies where any specifications are incomplete, which are November 2022 CC:2022 Page 163 of 211 then identified as inputs into testing (ACO_CTT) and vulnerability analysis (ACO_VUL) activities of the composed TOE. Testing of the composed TOE is performed to determine that the composed TOE exhibits the expected behaviour as determined by the composed TOE SFRs, and at higher levels demonstrates the compatibility of the interfaces between the components of the composed TOE. The vulnerability analysis of the composed TOE leverages from the outputs of the vulnerability analysis of the component evaluations. The composed TOE vulnerability analysis considers any residual vulnerabilities from the component evaluations to determine that the residual vulnerabilities are not applicable to the composed TOE. A search of publicly available information relating to the components is also performed to identify any issues reported in the components since the completion of the respective evaluations. The interaction between the ACO families is depicted in Figure 14 below. This shows by solid arrowed lines where the evidence and understanding gained in one family feeds into the next activity and the dashed arrows identify where an activity explicitly traces back to the composed TOE SFRs, as described above. Further discussion of the definition and interactions within composed TOEs is provided in Annex B.</p>
