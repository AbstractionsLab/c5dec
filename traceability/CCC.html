        <h1 id="CCC-001">1.0 FAU Security Audit <small>CCC-001</small></h1>
<p>Security auditing involves recognizing, recording, storing, and analyzing information related to security relevant activities (i.e. activities controlled by the TSF). The resulting audit records can be examined to determine which security relevant activities took place and whom (which user) is responsible for them. Annex C provides explanatory information for this class and should be consulted when using the components identified in this class.</p>

<h2 id="CCC-002">1.1 FCO Communication <small>CCC-002</small></h2>
<p>This class provides two families specifically concerned with assuring the identity of a party participating in a data exchange. These families are related to assuring the identity of the originator of transmitted information (proof of origin) and assuring the identity of the recipient of transmitted information (proof of receipt). These families ensure that an originator cannot deny having sent the message, nor can the recipient deny having received it.

<h2 id="CCC-003">1.2 FCS Cryptographic support <small>CCC-003</small></h2>
<p>The TSF may employ cryptographic functionality to help satisfy several high-level security objectives. These include, but are not limited to: identification and authentication, non-repudiation, trusted path, trusted channel, and data separation. This class is used when the TOE implements cryptographic functions, the implementation of which can be in hardware, firmware and/or software. The FCS: Cryptographic support class is composed of four families.

<h2 id="CCC-004">1.3 FDP User data protection <small>CCC-004</small></h2>
<p>This class contains families specifying requirements related to protecting user data. FDP: User data protection is split into four groups of families (listed below) that address user data within a TOE, during import, export, and storage as well as security attributes directly related to user data. The families in this class are organized into four groups:
1. user data protection SFPs:
    - Access control policy (FDP_ACC);
    - Information flow control policy (FDP_IFC).
Components in these families permit the author of a PP, PP-Module, functional package or ST to name the user data protection SFPs and define the scope of control of the policy, necessary to address the security objectives. The names of these policies are meant to be used throughout the remainder of the functional components that have an operation that calls for an assignment or selection of an "access control SFP" or an "information flow control SFP". The rules that define the functionality of the named access control and information flow control SFPs will be defined in the Access control functions (FDP_ACF) and Information flow control functions (FDP_IFF) families (respectively).
2. forms of user data protection:
    - Access control functions (FDP_ACF);
    - Information flow control functions (FDP_IFF);
    - Internal TOE transfer (FDP_ITT);
    - Information Retention Control (FDP_IRC)
    - Residual information protection (FDP_RIP);
    - Rollback (FDP_ROL);
    - Stored data confidentiality (FDP_SDC);
    - Stored data integrity (FDP_SDI).
3. off-line storage, import and export:
    - Data authentication (FDP_DAU);
    - Export from the TOE (FDP_ETC);
    - Import from outside of the TOE (FDP_ITC).
Components in these families address the trustworthy transfer into or out of the TOE.
4. inter-TSF communication:
    - Inter-TSF user data confidentiality transfer protection (FDP_UCT);
    - Inter-TSF user data integrity transfer protection (FDP_UIT).
Components in these families address communication between the TSF of the TOE and another trusted IT product.</p>

<h2 id="CCC-005">1.4 FIA Identification and authentication <small>CCC-005</small></h2>
<p>Families in this class address the requirements for functions to establish and verify a claimed user identity. Identification and authentication are required to ensure that users are associated with the proper security attributes The unambiguous identification of authorized users and the correct association of security attributes with users and subjects is critical to the enforcement of the intended security policies. The families in this class deal with determining and verifying the identity of users, determining their authority to interact with the TOE, and with the correct association of security attributes for each authorized user. Other classes of requirements are dependent upon correct identification and authentication of users in order to be effective.

<h2 id="CCC-006">1.5 FTM Security management <small>CCC-006</small></h2>
<p>This class is intended to specify the management of several aspects of the TSF: security attributes, TSF data and functions. The different management roles and their interaction, such as separation of capability, can be specified. This class has the following objectives:
1. management of TSF data;
2. management of security attributes;
3. management of functions of the TSF;
4. definition of security roles.</p>

<h2 id="CCC-008">1.7 FPT Protection of the TSF <small>CCC-008</small></h2>
<p>This class contains families of functional requirements that relate to the integrity and management of the mechanisms that constitute the TSF and to the integrity of TSF data. Although families in this class appear to duplicate components in the FDP: User data protection class, and they can be implemented using the same mechanisms. However, FDP: User data protection focuses on user data protection, while FPT: Protection of the TSF focuses on TSF data protection.
In fact, Components from the FPT: Protection of the TSF class are necessary to provide requirements that the SFPs in the TOE cannot be tampered with or bypassed. From the point of view of this class, regarding to the TSF there are three significant elements:
1. the TSF's implementation, which executes and implements the mechanisms that enforce the SFRs;
2. the TSF's data, which are the administrative databases that guide the enforcement of the SFRs;
3. the external entities that the TSF may interact with in order to enforce the SFRs.</p>

<h2 id="CCC-009">1.8 FRU Resource utilization <small>CCC-009</small></h2>
<p>This class provides three families that support the availability of required resources such as processing capability and/or storage capacity. The family Fault Tolerance provides protection against unavailability of capabilities caused by failure of the TOE. The family Priority of Service ensures that the resources will be allocated to the more important or time-critical tasks and cannot be monopolized by lower priority tasks. The family Resource Allocation provides limits on the use of available resources, therefore preventing users from monopolizing the resources.</p>

<h2 id="CCC-011">1.10 FTP Trusted path/channels <small>CCC-011</small></h2>
<p>Families in this class provide requirements for a trusted communication path between users and the TSF, and for a trusted communication channel between the TSF and other trusted IT products. Trusted paths and channels have the following general characteristics:
- the communications path is constructed using internal and external communications channels (as appropriate for the component) that isolate an identified subset of TSF data and commands from the remainder of the TSF and user data;
- use of the communications path can be initiated by the user and/or the TSF (as appropriate for the component);
- the communications path is capable of providing assurance that the user is communicating with the correct TSF, and that the TSF is communicating with the correct user (as appropriate for the component).</p>
<p>In this paradigm, a trusted channel is a communication channel that can be initiated by either side of the channel and provides non-repudiation characteristics with respect to the identity of the sides of the channel. A trusted path provides a means for users to perform functions through an assured direct interaction with the TSF. Trusted path is usually desired for user actions such as initial identification and/or authentication but can also be desired at other times during a user's session. Trusted path exchanges can be initiated by a user or the TSF. User responses via the trusted path are guaranteed to be protected from modification by or disclosure to untrusted applications. Families describing the use of commonly used communication protocols used in the provision of trusted channels and paths are also given.</p>
